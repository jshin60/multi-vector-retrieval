There are 8 python scripts that implement some version of the extension. If it is marked with a _s at the end, then it is
from the partitioning scheme mentioned and analyzed in the paper submission. Otherwise, it is similar, but instead of
sorting the partition results at the end, it simply reruns Muvera on the top k values among the partitions. Regardless,
all such scripts take similar inputs.

For all scripts path_to refers to the path to the Dataset folder. path_to_code refers to the path to the
csc200 folder. path_to should not end with a '\', but path_to_code should. partition_names refers to the
partition folders that will be utilized. So for each partition name in the list it will use the folders:
    dataset_name-partition_name[i]
when running the script to run and stor partition results. The d_proj and r_reps arrays indicate the d_projs and r_reps 
of each partition. The _s versions should have the same number of partition names, d_proj, and r_reps. The non _s ones should have one additional d_proj and r_rep for the final recombination muvera run. top_k indicates the the top k closest results you want to
generate. k_sim and n_candidate should be the same values as they are in the eval_muvera.py script (this is by defualt set up for
this repository, but if you want to change these values, you need to change them in two locations). q refers to the number of queries
that will be run (the ammount for lotte-500-gnd is 100). If Parallel = True, then instances of Muvera will be run in parallel,
otherwise they will run sequentially. build_index will build ground truths for each partition for you if true is given. Note that
you are required to have a groundtruths file of K for any input (partition or dataset) for this implementation of Muvera.

For non _s versions a seperate partition <dataset name>-re must be made the same way any other partition is made.

The main scripts used for the submission (the ones with _s) output time data as <dataset name>_topk_scheme_time.txt
and the recombined results as stats_for_topk.txt. All of our test results are in lotte-550-gnd-parallel-results_sorted,
lotte-550-gnd-sequential-results_sorted, and lotte-550-gnd-results.
