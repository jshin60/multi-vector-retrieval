907521	It has to do with the allocation unit sizes used on your disk when it was first formatted. Imagine you have two 2 x 10 gallon gas cans in your car. Each gas can is an allocation unit. You need to get 12 Gallons of gas, so you need to use both cans. Basically using 20 Gallons of allocated space - but only filling 12 gallons. Here is the default size for Windows XP Drive size (logical volume) Cluster size Sectors ---------------------------------------------------------- 512 MB or less 512 bytes 1 513 MB - 1,024 MB (1 GB) 1,024 bytes (1 KB) 2 1,025 MB - 2,048 MB (2 GB) 2,048 bytes (2 KB) 4 2,049 MB and larger 4,096 bytes (4 KB) 8 If you think of the Cluster size as each of your gas cans: Holding 4KB of "gas" each. But your file is 2KB then the fills size is 2K, but size on disk is 4KB
1262013	I was having this problem, but I realised windows has saved the edits! If you have a photo with an accompanying aae file, windows/apple is somehow making a copy of that photo. For example, if you have an apple photo IMG_2602 with IMG_2602.aae, another jpeg copy will be saved with IMG_e2602 and this image contains the edits. So we can go ahead and delete these aae files and it doesn’t have an issue with the img_exxxx copy
1177206	When you go to setup a WPS WiFi connection the printer should tell you the PIN to use via its LCD. See page 20 of the Brother Network User's Guide; "Using the PIN method of Wi-Fi Protected Setup": Press "Menu". Navigate to and select "Network". Navigate to and select "WLAN". Navigate to and select "WPS w/PIN Code". When "network I/F switched to Wireless" is displayed, press "OK". The LCD will show an 8 digit PIN and the machine will begin to start searching for a WLAN access point/router for up to 5 minutes.
1236152	In the latest versions [2020], the file system is accessed from: # \\wsl$\<Distribution>: \\wsl$\Ubuntu Previously, as of 2018, The current path is related to which distribution you have installed from the Microsoft Store rather than one global path; for Ubuntu, it was located at: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs Other distributions should be (to be confirmed) in a similar location under their respective folders within: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\
841586	From this perspective, modern ML regression techniques are not different to classic ones. A mean unbiased model on the log scale will automatically be mean biased after retransformation (by Jensen's inequality). Depending on the aim of your analysis, applying some retransformation bias correction factor might be useful as well for algorithms like XGBoost. (Be careful with models that impose L1/L2 penalties on the intercept though - a rare occasion.) The specific correction factor can be calculated directly from the residuals in the same way as for OLS.
1560634	It does look like it might be a swap problem. Can you manually fsck the drives from single-user mode (e.g., by booting into recovery mode)? You can do a sudo mv /var/run/motd /var/run/motd.old to force a clear of the current /etc/motd file. Also, can you add output of your from cat /etc/fstab ? For swap operations, see these answers: delete old swap partition How to delete a second swap partition safely? A nice graphical swap repair guide using gparted is here.
947367	I´ve got the same problem a while ago. In my case it was an almost defect HDD. The Computer rebooted (with bluescreen which I saw after disableing the automatic reboot) and couldn´t propperly reinitialize the boot order because the disk wasn´t recognized as it should be. Try doing a HDD-Stress-Test with some live-system. If it passes without errors you can be sure it isnt´the hdd. In that case I would follow digitxps suggestion and perform a BIOS flash.
997295	The acronym DNS means Domain Name System. It is a distributed system for translating host names (and other data) to IP addresses in a large scale (world). The name server is usually what people call the local DNS server that a workstation/PC can use as its entry point into the DNS. It will resolve local names, but delegates to other names servers for those it can't answer. There are many name servers, but you don't need to know how many since they are queried as needed. There are only a few "root" name servers (the DNS is hierarchical).
1763075	In PHP unlink() is a function for file system handling, unlink() is used to delete files. Suppose you have uploaded a file and wants to delete this file through the coding then unlink() function is used to delete the file. unset() is a function for variable management. It will make a variable undefined. Or we can say that unset() is used to null out the value of a given variable. OR Unset () is used to destroy a variable in PHP. In can be used to remove a single variable, multiple variables, or an element from an array.
47815	Your bad intonation is more likely to make your informal English sound unnatural than bad grammar is. Putting an extra bad in there to make the sentence less ambiguous is probably a good idea, although it can be omitted. I think is works here, because of the present tense of is more likely It makes more sense that the second half of the sentence is in the present tense as well. bad intonation is more likely to make your... bad grammar is more likely to make your... Although I would say that in casual conversation they could probably all be used and nobody would really notice.
58580	If you go back to market traders and speed talking trying to sell something. Try saying it: one buck for five now say quickly: five for a buck I don't know about you but my brain processes the 2nd one faster. A common tactic is to keep everything at the same price so: Apples 5 for a buck pears 3 for a buck bananas 2 for a buck You brain just registers I get 5 apples, 3 pears and don't need to hear the rest of the sentences. Easier to communicate in a market square vocally and therefore carried on to mainstream sales.
388990	Abjure the easier path of using the Clones, when they were an unknown quantity, and morally questionable at best. They would have lost some territory, to be sure, but they could have raised an involved, patriotic army rather than chucking the responsibility to the clones. This has parallels to the Romans in Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, whereby an increasingly spoiled citizen class outsources defense of the realm to the provincial yokels, and ultimately falls apart... Palpatine knew the heart of the times, and knew that this wouldn't happen, especially with him in control.
545658	The electrode at which oxidation takes place is known as the anode, while the electrode at which reduction take place is called the cathode. Reduction -> cathode Oxidation -> anode If you see galvanic cell reduction take place at the left electrode, so the left one is the cathode. Oxidation takes place at the right electrode, so the right one is the anode. While in electrolytic cell reduction takes place at the right electrode, so right one is the cathode. Oxidation takes place at the left electrode, so the left one is the anode.
2259932	The meaning of 'pulse' is fairly set (unless we're going to get silly and bring vegetables into it). It's the 'click track' behind the music. The heartbeat. Well - the 'pulse'. 'Beat' has a variety of musical meanings. It can mean the physical gesture made by the conductor. In some modern 'techno' music it can mean a sampled fragment endlessly repeated. It can be used to approve the rhythmic drive of a piece - you'll hear 'That song has a great beat!' rather than 'That song has a great pulse!' Not a term used much about 'classical' music, though some of it has an excellent 'beat'!
135618	What makes your main character as Main? Does it have special powers? Is a wise person? Does he/she is made out through writing? One who makes everything right at the end. If Yes. Be careful to plot the story. Plan well from the beginning. Make your side characters powerful, in parallel, make strong reasons for the main character to leave. Make your readers think/guess of multiple reasons for his/her leaving. Sometimes it can make your story more powerful than before, but sometimes it can backfire and make everything uninteresting. So Yes, the main characters can leave early provided you handle it carefully.
1122599	A format describes the structure of some data, whereas a protocol defines a procedure to handle this data. If you take TCP as an example, you have a definition of the format of a data packet, which tells you at which bit position a specified field like the checksum of a packet starts and ends, and the protocol defines that for opening a TCP connection you need three packets, one from client to server with the SYN-bit set, a second one from server to client with ACK- and SYN-bit set and a third one with ACK-bit set from client to server.
1999427	There are two possible reasons for this: 1) You are running JunOS Worldwide, which does not support encryption and as such will not have the SSH client (or servers for that matter) installed. 2) You are running Junos Domestic which DOES support encryption, but the package is corrupted. Solutions: 1) Upgrade from Junos Worldwide to Junos Domestic 2) Reinstall Junos to restore the package OR turn on FTP services and copy the missing packages from another extracted download and replace the corrupted files in the filesystem. EDIT: Option 3: Call JTAC and make them fix it :)
1001021	thumbs.db is where the thumbnail images for files are stored. They will only be visible if you have your folder options set to display hidden and system files. They are not viral. If you delete a thumbs.db file, the next time you open that folder, Windows will have to re-determine the thumbnail for each file. Also, in Folder Options, selecting "Do not cache thumbnails" will prevent the thumbs.db files from being created. However, these files help the computer navigate through your directories more quickly, so unless you have a specific reason for not needing or wanting them, just leave them alone.
1178831	First, let's look at the whole command: echo "I<RA('1E<W3t`rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r`26<F]F;==" | uudecode It contains a double-quoted string that gets echoed to uudecode. But, note that, within the double-quoted string is a back-quoted string. This string gets executed. The string is: `rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r` If we look at what's in it, we see three commands: rYWdl & r()(Y29j & r{,3Rl7Ig} & r{,T31wo}) r Performing brace expansion on the middle command, we have: rYWdl & r()(Y29j & r r3Rl7Ig & r rT31wo) r The first line tries to run a nonsense command in background. This is unimportant. The second line is important: it defines a function r which, when run, launches two copies of itself. Each of those copies would, of course, launch two more copies. And so on. The third line runs r, starting the fork bomb. The rest of the code, outside of the back-quoted string, is just nonsense for obfuscation. How to run the command safely This code can be run safely if we set limit on function nesting level. This can be done with bash's FUNCNEST variable. Here, we set it to 2 and this stops the recursion: $ export FUNCNEST=2 $ echo "I<RA('1E<W3t`rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r`26<F]F;==" | uudecode bash: rYWdl: command not found bash: Y29j: command not found bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: Y29j: command not found bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: Y29j: command not found uudecode fatal error: standard input: Invalid or missing 'begin' line The error messages above show that (a) the nonsense commands rYWdl and Y29j are not found, (b) the fork bomb gets repeatedly stopped by FUNCNEST, and (c) the output of echo does not start with begin and, consequently, is not valid input for uudecode. The fork bomb in its simplest form What would the fork bomb look like if we removed the obscuration? As njzk2 and gerrit suggest, it would look like: echo "`r()(r&r);r`" We can simplify that even further: r()(r&r); r That consists of two statements: one defines the fork-bomb-function r and the second runs r. All the other code, including the pipe to uudecode, was there just for obscuration and misdirection. The original form had yet another layer of misdirection The OP has provided a link to the chann board discussion on which this code appeared. As presented there, the code looked like: eval $(echo "I<RA('1E<W3t`rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r`26<F]F;==" | uudecode) Notice one of the first comments about this code: I fell for it. Copied only the part that echoes and decodes, but still got forkbombed In the form on the chann board, one would naively think that the problem would be the eval statement operating on the output of uudecode. This would lead one to think that removing eval would solve the problem. As we have seen above, this is false and dangerously so.
1258516	Four steps for windows 10 pro to pin your Debian/Ubuntu/OpenSUSE $HOME to the start menu of Windows: From start menu start File Explorer In address bar (not search bar) type %LOCALAPPDATA%. In search bar look for your $HOME directory name, in my case it was ekenny. There will be about 3 versions of this but you want the one with really long path. Right click your home directory and click "Pin to Start". Now you have your home directory pinned to your start menu. I tried creating a shortcut but that doesn't go anywhere intelligible.
1997267	The difference is which architecture SQL Server expects to run on: x86 = 32-bit or 64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs w/ 32-bit or 64-bit Windows OS x64 = 64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs w/ 64-bit Windows OS IA64 = Intel Itanium CPUs running IA64 Windows OS You can discount IA64 -- if you were using it, you'd know it. So that leaves x64 vs x86, which is a tradeoff you need to balance for yourself. In most cases, if you're running Windows x64, you'll want to use SQL Server x64 too.
146935	Try Double Metaphone. The idea behind it is to "hash" similar sounds to the same letters, putting words with similar orthography into an equivalence class. One application is in genealogy, where a historical surname might have dozens of realisations. Your examples would encode to: KRSSTLTFRTSNTLKX0R and KRXSTRLRTRSRTSNTLKXTR and edit distance could provide a metric. Note that Double Metaphone, Soundex and its ilk are only heuristics, and grossly ignore orthography in order to obtain a rough representation.
433585	Kylo Ren has two parents: Han Solo and Leia Organa. Leia is the daughter of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, making Kylo Ren the grandson of Anakin/Vader. Leia refers to their son a number of times in conversation with Han. He met her eyes steadily. “We’ve lost our son, forever.” “Always,” she told him. “From the shadows, in the beginning, even before I realized what was happening, he was manipulating everything, pulling our son toward the dark side. “If you see our son,” Leia whispered, “bring him home.”
1518904	The problem is ls. It was never designed to be used in scripts. Besides, it's also pointless to use ls in scripts, because the shell can do the job much better, by simply using a glob, see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Patterns zenlist="/tmp/zen list"; touch "$zenlist" "$zenlist"$'\neven with a newline' zenity --list --title='A single-column List' --width=600 --height=450 \ --column='Spaces are allowed within "q u o t e s"' \ "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck," \ "if a wooodchuck could chuck wood?" \ "$zenlist"* And for a general way to put list items with spaces and other chars into a "variable", use bash arrays. # assign some items to start with items=( "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck," "if a wooodchuck could chuck wood?" ) # append some items items+=( "$zenlist"* ) zenity --list --title='A single-column List' --width=600 --height=450 \ --column='Spaces are allowed within "q u o t e s"' "${items[@]}"
44285	Early means 'before a specified or expected time'. earlier also means 'before a specified or expected time' and the specified or expected time can itself be an early time, in which case "earlier" means "more early". The reference time changes. The meeting is at 7PM. Could you arrive early to help me set out chairs? The meeting is at 7PM. Could you arrive an hour earlier to help me set out chairs? Last week, you arrived at 6pm to help put out chairs for the 7pm meeting. Tomorrow, would you be able to arrive a little earlier, at 5:30, to help me set up the sound system too?
70206	Q: What is the thing in: "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all." A: It is the event that "On the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all." It may become clearer if you shuffle that around a bit to arrive at "The Muggles found out about us all on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last" In conclusion the fine thing is both of these big events happening on the very same day.
808571	Technically, the Moon is Full at a specific time. Therefore you need to check the time of sunset/moonrise OR sunrise/moonset that is closest to the time of Full Moon. Then you can more accurately compare the variation. Here is the list for 2019 created using the U.S. Naval Observatory website. Longitude E9° 8', Latitude N41° 35' All times in Universal Time (UT) Date of Full Moon -------- Sun ---------- -------- Moon -------- Moon-Sun Date Time Date Time Date Time Diff 1/21/2019 5:16 Rise 1/21/2019 6:45 Set 1/21/2019 6:54 +0:09 2/19/2019 15:53 Set 2/19/2019 17:01 Rise 2/19/2019 16:55 -0:06 3/21/2019 1:43 Rise 3/21/2019 5:26 Set 3/21/2019 5:58 +0:32 4/19/2019 11:12 Set 4/19/2019 18:08 Rise 4/19/2019 18:14 +0:06 5/18/2019 21:11 Set 5/18/2019 18:39 Rise 5/18/2019 18:14 -0:25 6/17/2019 8:31 Rise 6/17/2019 3:49 Set 6/17/2019 3:54 +0:05 7/16/2019 21:38 Set 7/16/2019 18:56 Rise 7/16/2019 18:49 -0:07 8/15/2019 12:29 Rise 8/15/2019 4:32 Set 8/15/2019 4:09 -0:23 9/14/2019 4:33 Rise 9/14/2019 5:02 Set 9/14/2019 4:59 -0:03 10/13/2019 21:08 Set 10/13/2019 16:46 Rise10/13/2019 17:02 +0:16 11/12/2019 13:34 Set 11/12/2019 16:07 Rise11/12/2019 16:25 +0:18 12/12/2019 5:12 Rise 12/12/2019 6:40 Set12/12/2019 6:42 +0:02 The difference is much smaller than your original list. Why this happens MCG and Carl Witthoft explained why it happens, namely because: If the moonrise/set is not the same time as the exact Full Moon, then moonrise/set occurs earlier or later than the sunset/rise. Because the Moon passes above and below the ecliptic (the path of the Sun in the sky), the Full Moon is rarely directly opposite from the Sun. Therefore, it can rise earlier or later than the Sun even when exactly "Full". Even if the Full Moon were exactly opposite from the Sun (180 degrees apart, and in a total lunar eclipse), there would still be a difference between the time of sunset/moonrise. Those times are when the limb of the sun/moon is visible, and the limbs are closer together than 180 degrees apart. Also, atmospheric refraction shrinks the separation a small amount. Where and when are they closest? This is more involved but can be reasoned using the following figure. The Sun is in the direction of 1, so the ring of sunset-sunrise is the circle A-A. The Full Moon is in the direction of 2, so the ring of moonrise-moonset is the circle B-B. Where these two circles cross at C is where the sunset and moonrise (or sunrise and moonset) occur at the same time. The highlighted area is where the Moon and Sun are both above the horizon at the same time. Note that this figure is highly exaggerated for illustrative purposes.
545012	Well, since the pressure in the tank will decrease with usage, you can't ultimately do what you seem to want to do. At a given backing pressure, there are equations to determine the orafice size to get a flow rate - google 'choked flow'. Downstream of the regulator, your orafice should be good for quite some time. For an experimental setup, one would use either a mass flow controller (MFC) to actively control the flow rate, or (much cheaper) one of those little flow indicators with the ball floating in the He (air) stream. Note the second option here is basically an adjustable orafice with integrated flow indicator.
1396092	Generally I prefer to use numbering of components based on the functional block staring with 100, 200, aso. As an example, the power section will have components numbered 1XX (ie R101, C101, U101), the RF will have 3XX (ie R301, L301, U301, Q301), aso. Having it this way also helps me with the BOM and future service/debugging. I never reuse the component identification (number) in a new version of the schematic. Helps everyone that has to look at the PCB/schematic in the future and keeps documentation consistent.
900591	If the Windows Firewall is turned off then it will have no effect, and the Inbound and Outbound rules will mean nothing. Inbound rules: These are to do with other things accessing your computer. If you are running a Web Server on your computer then you will have to tell the Firewall that outsiders are allowed to connect to it. Outbound rules: These are so that you can let some programs use the Internet, and Block others. You will want to let your Web Browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera...) have access to the Internet, so you will tell Windows Firewall that it's allowed.
493572	The 50mm is "standard" because it's a cheap lens to produce, and in the era of slow films, having a fast max aperture for little money was a good thing for most photographers. Many SLRs were sold with a 50/1.8 or 50/2 as a kit lens. When films became faster most consumers found a slower zoom lens to be more versatile. I believe Oskar Barnack, the creator of the small-format camera (the Leica) chose 50mm as a standard lens because even if it was longer than the theoretical standard of 43mm it was easier to produce a good 50mm using the technology of the time.
789247	Some examples: https://www.academiclabs.com/ Open Science Framework https://www.scilifelab.se/: Open for collaboration: an academic platform for drug discovery and development at SciLifeLab (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2016.06.026) https://www.kaggle.com/ to some extent can be used to find academic collaborations centered around a given data set (example). https://researchgate.net was mentioned in some other answers, but it is very scammy, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ResearchGate&oldid=947542863#Criticism Should I send a “cease-and-desist” letter to ResearchGate? ResearchGate: an asset or a waste of time? https://www.academia.edu/ also has their own issues, e.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academia.edu&oldid=945557467#Criticism Why does academia.edu reserve the right to sell, modify, and “exploit” my papers if I post them there? Is Academia.edu useful?
333593	If the attacks land, the creature would have the opportunity to initiate a grapple, with itself as the controlling grappler. Since the roll is the same (CMB vs CMD) both for initiating a new grapple and to become the dominant grappler, when already grappling, the only difference is that the creature can deal damage before attempting the grapple. Constrict lets you deal damage when succeeding a grapple check. Initiating a grapple is a success and so is becoming the dominant grappler as such it wouldn't matter if it was made with Grap or trying to control the grapple.
1772295	Although the use of Ctrl+Alt+↑ and Ctrl+Alt+↓ are currently suggested for column selection in Sublime Text 3 for Linux, they don't work. Instead, one has to use alt+shift and the appropriate arrow key according to this technical support response. To get these keybindings to work in Lubuntu 18.04, I commented out the following lines in ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml: <keybind key="S-A-Left"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>left</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> <keybind key="S-A-Right"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>right</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> <keybind key="S-A-Up"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>up</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> <keybind key="S-A-Down"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>down</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> saved the file, ran openbox --reconfigure and now I can use Shift+Alt together with the appropriate arrow keys to select a column of text in Sublime Text v 3.2.1. Note: openbox --reconfigure does two things: It parses your rc.xml or menu.xml files for errors and it "reloads" the edited (and saved) file so you don't have to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect. Note: If you have LXDE the file to modify is ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml instead.
2104877	No and yes. By standard, your sender domain is not required to have an MX record. RFC 5321 makes an MX record optional although it's somewhat of a standard today. However, due to spamming practices, a number of receiving servers may reject your messages when there's no MX record for the sender's domain. Since it is no big deal to set up an MX record it is highly recommended to do so for serious traffic. As @MichaelHampton has pointed out, you need to be able to accept messages for the sender's domain in any case - including the postmaster@ and abuse@ aliases - to avoid being categorized as spam.
672376	Indeed, since the likelihood function $$\prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k p_j \varphi(x_i;\mu_j,\sigma_j)$$ is available in closed form, a regular maximisation algorithm like the gradient methods could be applied to this function. Unfortunately, they cannot work because the likelihood is not regular enough for them to find the global maximum: there are several equivalent local modes; it may happen that the likelihood is unbounded at the boundaries of the parameter space. The EM algorithm also ends up in a local mode, hence shares some of these drawbacks but it is usually fast and can be repeated with different starting points to find a global mode.
985823	They will only be within http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) And that's not just the defaults, that's all you can set them to too. Those are the 3 private IP ranges. As specified by RFC 1918 Now, as far as what is common. That could change in future. But from what i've seen, the 192.168/16 range is most common. Second to that is the 10/8 range. I've seen that too, as you have. It's not uncommon And I've never seen a router set to use anything on 172.16/12 but they could.
2162135	From what I have gathered the only way to be absolutely certain is by probing which should only be done by a herpetologist. However, that may not always be possible, so you can also determine based on the tail. Males have thicker and longer tails, while the females have short and thin tails. Other details can be the size of the snake altogether since males are normally larger, however some exceptions may be out there. Also, male corn snakes that are on the bigger side often have subtle dark streaks that travel down the length of their bodies -- four in total. These streaks do not generally appear in the smaller males of the species, however. Hope this helps
2018127	It depends. Andrew B's answer is spot on, when you register the subdomain in the public DNS zone which also hosts your companies MX records and public website for instance. Most companies would have an internal DNS server, not publically available where you would register the host names for your internal (secret) hosts. Recommended method is to register a dedicated domain for internal use, or alternatively create a subdomain in your primary domain for internal use. But technically you also use your primary domain by creating an internal view on your domain, where depending on the origin of the DNS client an alternate version of the DNS zone would be visible.
851230	Gradient Descent is an algorithm to minimize the $J(\Theta)$! Idea: For current value of theta, calculate the $J(\Theta)$, then take small step in direction of negative gradient. Repeat. Update Equation = Algorithm: while True: theta_grad = evaluate_gradient(J,corpus,theta) theta = theta - alpha * theta_grad But the problem is $J(\Theta)$ is the function of all corpus in windows, so very expensive to compute. Stochastic Gradient Descent repeatedly sample the window and update after each one Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm: while True: window = sample_window(corpus) theta_grad = evaluate_gradient(J,window,theta) theta = theta - alpha * theta_grad Usually the sample window size is the power of 2 say 32, 64 as mini batch.
1276916	On my setup (WSL Ubuntu under the "Windows 10 development environment" downloaded from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines) the AppData folder was hidden by default. So had to: open windows explorer go to C:\Users\User\ select view on the meny check hidden items then the AppData folder appears under C:\Users\User and I found my /home/user under C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_*\LocalState\rootfs\home\user (where * is probably a local code or version depending code of some sorts) Don't know why it's tucked away like that.
2283078	The general rule (in the US) is 7-11 (a 7 inch rise and 11 inch run) (17.78cm-27.94cm). More exactly, no more than 7 3/4 inches (19.7cm) for the riser (vertical) and a minimum of 10 inches (25.4cm) for the tread (horizontal or step). You can find some more information here as well on other stair-related dimensions. To calculate if the steps will be within the Building Codes specs : 2 times the step riser height + 1 tread width equals between 24 and 25 in inches (60.96cm and 63.5cm). example: (2 x 7.5") + 10 = 25 (2 x 19.05cm + 10 = 48.1cm)
2413642	Many other answers give tips like pulling the fuse or cutting wires. Please note that if your question is about the defective Takata airbags, this won't help! The problem is, that this airbags propellants are not properly sealed. "Moisture and humidity could be seeping inside inflators, destabilizing the volatile propellant inside." This means, in the worst case the airbag could explode without an electric ignition, because of the chemical reaction of the water and the propellant. Keep that in mind! Also, you should never ignore a recall on your car. Let a professional repair it. This could save your live, so it should be worth it for you!
58195	There is no reason nor is there a rule. It's all context based. If BK is talking about whoppers and they say "2 for 5" you can deduce two whoppers for five dollars. That's because it is the reasonable idea. It is not two dollars for five whoppers... that's too cheap to make any sense. If they were talking about individual chicken nuggets and they said "2 for 5" you would deduce two dollars for five nuggets. That price would be reasonable, whereas 5 dollars for only two little chicken nuggets is not. People will understand the phrase automatically in a way that makes sense.
1893276	No, you don't really "need" WSUS. If you really prefer to do things manually instead of using automation then by all means remove WSUS. On the other hand, I would consider the break-even point for WSUS, compared to manually managing updates, to be only one computer - the WSUS server itself. Even with just that one machine you gain much greater control over the updates using WSUS, so is well justified. The laptop does indeed present a problem, one many of us have had to deal with. For that I would simply use Microsoft's update site, although doing so pains me. Then again, I regularly block updates that simply don't have a reason to be installed.
225888	For 'trivial murder', I'd say it's dubious if you cannot guarantee the body has the enhanced physiology necessary for the limbs/neck to do damage to the important parts of the body. IMO your best bet would be freezing all vital organ function for the whole duration the body is controlled, but depending on the length of time this might not be enough to guarantee bodily death. However, the point of a setting like that is that the constraints of a body, including its destruction can now be worked around. 'True murder', meaning destruction of the chip that houses the consciousness would be effectively impossible without access to specific tools or engineered circumstances(eg: standing next to a vat of acid)
1393467	Adding a voltage regulator would dissipate more power (although not much, if it's a good switching regulator), which isn't desirable in a battery-operated device. If those chips are meant to run over that full range, then I would take advantage of that. They were probably designed that way to address battery-powered applications. If you want over-voltage protection, put a zener diode across the battery input. That would also give you reverse-battery protection and won't draw additional power (except possibly for a little leakage). Select one whose zener voltage is greater than one battery and is less than two batteries. The current carrying capability should be greater than the current capability of the battery.
1375582	Voltage is a difference of electric potential. To simplify, it is an measure of the difference in concentration of electrons between two points. Volts is a unit of measure of voltage. It would be pretty difficult to have exactly no electron on an electrode, and as the voltage is the difference of potential, it is always relative to somthing. Usually, we say that a given electrode has \$X\$ volts and that implied relative to the ground of the circuit. The voltage of the ground is 0 volts, because it is referenced to itself. However, if you measure the voltage of a ground in one circuit, as a reference of another ground in another circuit, you may see some difference (non-zero).
1496183	Actually there's an easier way.... I never thought in simply trying Ctrl+F on the main window hahaha. That's all you have to do! Ctrl+F on the circuit and a search box will appear. You can search nodes and components there. I just tried. Example: Does exactly what @jonk was hoping to find: highlight the node. Not sure why this is now shown on the submenus or on the Hot Keys section of Settings. If it is on the submenus, I don't find it. And I found the shortcut by accident. Didn't know what happened for that to appear. Until I tried the most simple shortcut and it worked xD.
58193	It's a more-or-less idiomatic construction declaring an exchange rate. Objectively, it doesn't actually matter what's being exchanged for what; if it's burgers for bucks, bananas for books, or cookies for crayons, "two for five" implies that two of something is being exchanged for five of something else. In this case, Burger King is offering to exchange two burgers for five bucks. Normally, in a case like this, one would think that the person with the bucks is buying burgers. If it helps, think of it a little backwards - BK is buying bucks, and paying in burgers, so they're paying two burgers to buy five bucks - "two burgers for five bucks".
58217	The phrases "Buy 2 hamburgers for 5 dollars" and "Spend 2 dollars to get 5 hamburgers" could both be reasonably shortened to "2 for 5". (As Danikov points out, "Buy 2 for the price of 1" is frequently shortened to "2 for 1", making "Buy 2 for the price of 5" an odd, but reasonable interpretation for the phrase as well.) Burger King knows this, which is why they immediately clarify the ambiguity. As to why "Buy 2 for 5 dollars" is preferred over "Spend 5 dollars to get 2", that comes down to psychology. Typically the beginning of a sentence gets more attention than the middle, and Burger King wants listeners to be focused on what they are getting, not what they are spending.
491162	I have a 50mm 1.8 (which unfortunately won't auto-focus for you) and the 35mm 1.8 DX. As mentioned above, the 50mm is really great for portraits - the crop factor with the 50mm gives lovely focus and crispness. I just recently bought the 35mm 1.8 DX lens from B&H and it too is quite good - great in lower light situations and fairly small (in size) so it doesn't add much weight to your camera. I paid about $190 for it, which is great considering how good these 'cheap' prime lenses actually are (as mentioned by Ian P above). For low-light close up photos i don't think you'll be disappointed with it.
437080	In the movie with T. Maguire, Spidey stops a subway train with his net and his arm while standing on front (stupid to think the net wouldn't crush the wall) and not trying to cut of the power. So he is standing there and is trying to stop an accelerating train. Some math? http://www.efm.leeds.ac.uk/CIVE/CIVE1140/examples/examples_solutions_answers_section2_01.pdf Or someone did it before http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2284273/Spiderman-really-COULD-stopped-train-web-say-physics-students-have.html So it would need 300.000kN of Force. Or something at 300 metric tons. Ok inconsistent, as someone said above he is ranged around - 10-20t normally.
572179	I just add a good mnemonic tool how to remember the naming convention : Anode = anabasis ( from Greek ana = "upward", bainein = "to step or march") , electrons would be going upwards from the electrode to the wire = oxidation. Xenophon, Anabasis, "The March Up Country" Cathode = cathabasis (the journey downwards), electrons would be going downwards from the wire to the electrode = reduction The terms anabasis/catabasis have application in other domains as well. E.g. anabatic/cathabatic processes in synoptical meteorology are processes related to upward/downward convection of air, like at the front and the back side of the cold front of the 2nd kind.
491148	Most standard because: 50mm on a full frame is said to give a natural field of view. 50mm is apparently an simple focal length to design On a your crop sensor, it is 75e, while the 35mm is 52.5e. Thus, the 35mm lens will be closer to "normal" Reasons why most photographers may choose the 50mm could be to use it for portraits on crop sensors. 75e is a great focal length for portraits, especially when combined with such a wide aperture. Other reasons may include: higher resolution, smoother bokeh, better color, better rendition, higher contrast and microcontrast, more flare resistance, less CA, less distortion, less vignetting, better build quality, faster AF, etc.
942514	A function is a built-in operation, such as SUM(), AVERAGE(), etc. A formula (also known as an equation) is something that the user defines, and can use/refer to various functions in it. A formula starts with an = sign, such as =(D1+D2)/A$3. They are similar in that both return a result based on the calculations that each performs. The difference is that a function is a built-in calculation, while a formula is a user-defined calculation. A formula could just use a single function. For example, if you enter =AVERAGE(A1:A56), that is a formula, using the AVERAGE function. If you enter =SUM(G4+A5) - 25 * MIN(B3:B6), that is a formula which uses both the SUM function and the MIN function, as well as standard mathematical operators (-, +, *).

If so, run this script, and restart the service. exec sp_dropserver '<oldhostname>\instance' go exec sp_addserver '<newhostname>\instance' , local go Once the service is restarted, open a new query and run the first script again, it should now reflect the new hostname.

556977	The dichotomy between weak- and strong-field ligands that I have often seen constructed here is false and physically inaccurate. Complexes can be in a low-spin state or in a high-spin state. The high-spin state is the one according to Hund’s rule where electrons are filled into the five d orbitals one after the other. A low-spin state is any complex in which the Hund rule is not strictly observed, but some orbitals are filled with two electrons while others remain empty. Classic examples for high-spin complexes are, e.g. $\ce{[FeCl6]^3-, [CoCl4]^2-}$ and others. Examples for low-spin complexes are, e.g. $\ce{[Fe(CN)6]^3-, [Cr(CN)6]^3-}$ and others. While these examples may seem to exemplify your stated dichotomy (with chloride being on the weak-field side and cyanide being on the high-field side), reality is much more complex and the spin state of a complex depends on ligands, metal, oxidation state, counterions and so on. In fact, for 2-picolylamine ($\ce{2{-}pic}$) as a ligand to iron(II), both the low-spin and the high-spin $\ce{[Fe(2{-}pic)3]^2+}$ complexes have been isolated and characterised by crystal structures. The $\ce{Fe-N}$ bond length differs by $19~\mathrm{pm}$ with the high-spin complex obviously having longer bonds. Complexes have a tendency to be in the low-spin state if the metal is not a 3d metal the metal’s oxidation state is higher metal to ligand π-backbonding can take place. Especially that final point is important. Ammonia is very bad at π backbonding (and amide is even π-donating). So calling it a high-field ligand is misappreciating physicochemical reality. It is just ammonia’s strong σ bonding ability that causes a slightly larger field split than water. As such, ammonia is best termed a medium-field ligand. (The same is true for most neutral nitrogen donors.)
1878161	I made a diagram that may be helpful: With regard to static routing, consider the above diagram. We have three separate networks: 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, and 192.168.3.0. At first, network hosts (routers, computers, etc.) can only communicate with other hosts that are on their own network. For instance, the computer named James has a single interface on network 192.168.1.0, so that's the only network that it can 'see'. Initially, it will only be able to communicate with Router A. Router A has network interfaces on the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks, so those are the two networks that it can 'see'. These are the only networks Router A 'knows' about, so it can only communicate with hosts on the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks. So Router A doesn't even 'know' that the 192.168.3.0 network exists. Similarly, Router B can 'see' networks 192.168.2.0 and 192.168.3.0. When you enter a route into the table, you're telling a host that there's a new network it can get to, and you're giving it the address of a gateway that it can use to get to the new network. So to be able to contact Jesus (or any other host on the 192.168.3.0 network) from Router A, you'd enter the command: ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2 ^ ^ ^ network mask gateway This works because Router B can 'see' both Router A and Jesus. Thanks to this routing table entry when Router A wants to reach the 192.168.3.0 network, it knows it can get there via Router B at 192.168.2.2, so it sends the packet to Router B. Router B can see the 192.168.3.0 network directly, so it forwards the packet along to Jesus at 192.168.3.11. So, now we know how to direct router A to the 192.168.3.0 network. But what if we want James to also be able to reach the 192.168.3.0 network? Well, Router A already knows how to get there, and James can already 'see' Router A, since they're both on network 192.168.1.0. So we can just tell James to use Router A as its gateway to the 192.168.3.0 network. If James were a router instead of a computer, we'd use the command: ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 ^ ^ ^ network mask gateway James would then be able to contact Jesus (or any host on the 192.168.3.0) network by forwarding the packet to 192.168.1.1 (Router A), which would then forward the packet to 192.168.2.2 (Router B) which would then forward the packet to its destination (Jesus in this case) via its directly connected interface. Now, for Jesus to be able to respond to James, Jesus would need to have Router B set up as its gateway to the 192.168.1.0 network, and Router B would have to have Router A set up as its gateway to the 192.168.1.0 network. Then, any host on the 192.168.1.0 network would have a path to the 192.168.3.0 network and vice versa. Hope that helps.
568524	I mean this answer as a complement to previous answers. As already disccused, in the anode you will always have an oxidation reaction $\mathrm{ \;Red\; \longrightarrow \; Ox + e^-} $, while in the cathode you will observe the reduction reaction $\mathrm{\;Red\; + e^- \longrightarrow \; Ox }$. The reduction and oxidation reactions are always coupled, so one electrode acts as a source of electrons and the other as a sink. In the galvanic cell, the overall reaction is spontaneous and the current flows from the anode to the cathode. On the other hand, in an electrolytic cell, we drive the reaction in a non-spontaneous sense applying an external potential (for example, using a power supply). I think this image should make clear the operation of both kinds of cells, the processes that occur at each electrode, and the sign convention. Although it illustrates a specific reaction, you may generalised it to other systems. The source of the image is Electrolysis I at Chemistry.LibreTexts.
726586	The important thing here is that you realize that you do need to report this information to schools to which you will be applying, as it will matter in their deliberations over your application. That said, you do have some degree of latitude in finding the best way to inform the schools of this. If they have a "special notes" or "additional information" question in the application, that might be a good place to put such information. Otherwise, you would want to mention it somewhere in the cover letter (if you get to include one) or personal statement (if you don't). However, this information should be provided by you; don't leave it for the people writing your recommendation letters to mention. That will just raise more red flags.
443733	There's a bit more information about Draco revealed in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child He had a son, Scorpius with whom he has a somewhat strained relationship. There were persistent rumours that his son was the illegitimate offspring of Voldemort. His wife died sometime during Scorpius' early childhood. Her death seems to have affected him deeply. DRACO: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. His wife was not a Death-Eater. His father did not approve of the match but he married her out of love. He maintained his father's collection of dark magic memorabilia.
695019	In a sense, yes, you can. As I alluded in my question here What *is* an Artificial Neural Network?, a decision tree is a neural network, lato sensu. So you can train these neural networks in parallel and combine then, with end-to-end gradient based optimization. Another way you could combine random forests is through gradient boosting. Usually, for gradient boosting, "weak" learners are combined into a "strong" learner. In random forests and bagging techniques in general, "strong", biased, learners, are combined into a, hopefully, more parsimonious model. But nothing precludes you from combining random forests in gradient boosting fashion, which answers "can I combine random Forests with an optimisation method like Gradient Descent or SGD?".
1586172	The warning means the host id has changed (from the old to the new installation). That's good! It works, letting you know it has changed... Log in as the unprivileged user (not root) and create the hidden directory, /home/jerry/.ssh: cd; mkdir .ssh; chmod 0700 .ssh At that point you can add hosts to the known_hosts file (/home/jerry/.ssh/known_hosts). Or, if you connect as guest, do the same as the user, guest, not jerry. Note that should you desire the .ssh directory to be created for all new users, then add a the .ssh directory to /etc/skel. The /etc/skel directory contains files and directories that all new users should have. sudo mkdir /etc/skel/.ssh; sudo chmod 0700 /etc/skel/.ssh Afterward, every new user you create will have a .ssh directory with the right perms (0700).
1626536	Very closely related questions have been asked before. Here are links to some of the answers: https://askubuntu.com/a/369920/248158 https://askubuntu.com/a/205447/248158 https://askubuntu.com/a/226861/248158 https://askubuntu.com/a/143406/248158 https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/25713 I like this explanation: Such messages are common with Gnome applications and do not necessarily indicate a bug. Gnome takes a dumbed-down approach to users; the intended audience won't run an application from a terminal and so won't see these messages. Redirect error output from Gnome applications to a log file if you really care, or to /dev/null otherwise. Source: Gilles. And this is also nice: This error indicates that the software is using perfectly valid GTK library calls with a newer version of the GTK library. Sometimes during software development it is desirable to get rid of the, "old way", to do things while maintaining backwards compatibility. This is accomplished by marking the undesired calls depreciated. This tells the developer that their code is perfectly valid in this release, but in the future their code will need to be updated to work with a new version of the library, possibly many releases down the road. In this case, GTK wants to be more strict about including units on dimensions. It tells the developer that GTK is assuming the units are pixels, which is the exact assumption that the software developer made in the first place. Source: Bailley S By the way, if you launch Firefox from terminal you'll may see a terrifying message like this: GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion But it seems to be harmless as per comment in Bug #833117. In short, there's mostly no need for us beginners to launch GUI-based apps from the terminal unless there's a problem and we need to give output to someone who can understand the meaning of such output.
370105	No. Eric Sink decided that he would start a micro-ISV to create a version of solitaire that is always winnable. This was mostly just an experiment to see what it would be like running a software company with one person, but he eventually sold the product which is still available for purchase. There have been some estimates about the number of Klondike Solitaire games that are unplayable (no moves possible, about 1 in 400), and several guesses about how many games are unwinnable, although this percentage varies wildly from 30%-10%. The difficulty of this problem stems from the sheer number of initial deals 54! that would need to be evaluated to determine which were winnable and which were not.
491154	In addition to the answer above, both variants of the 50mm prime lenses (Canon & Nikon mounts) offer a huge bang for the buck. Either lens (in the f/1.8 variety) can be had for under $100, or so. I wish I still had the pictures (I do -- I just have no idea where,) but I did a direct comparison at 50mm between my Canon 24-70 f/2.8 L (~$1,200 is what I think I paid some time ago,) and my Canon 50mm f/1.8 prime (I bought this for $50 off of a for-sale board.) If I recall correctly, the 50mm f/1.8 beat the 24-70 f/2.8L out at 50mm up to f/5.6. So, with that said, if you like to shoot at 50mm (or 80mm on a 1.6x crop, etc.,) then it's a no brainer :) Good luck! Ian
849246	I used a simple Neural Network with 3 Inputs - 1 hidden layer with 8 neurons - 3 Outputs (Labels) with k-fold crossvalidation in keras for your data set. import pandas as pd from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier from keras.utils import np_utils from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection import KFold from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, scale from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline path = r"User\train.csv" data = pd.read_csv(path) data.location.value_counts() dataset = data.values x = dataset[:,0:3] x_scaled = scale(x) y = dataset[:,3] encoder = LabelEncoder() encoder.fit(y) encoded_Y = encoder.transform(y) dummy_y = np_utils.to_categorical(encoded_Y) def model(): model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(8, input_dim=3, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax')) model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) return model estimator = KerasClassifier(build_fn=model, epochs=200, batch_size=5, verbose=0) kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True) results = cross_val_score(estimator, x_scaled, dummy_y, cv=kfold) print("Model Prediction: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)" % (results.mean()*100, results.std()*100)) The used Model can categorize around 94% of the data correctly. Maybe this helps for the start. Out: Prediction: 93.95% (3.13%) In data science and statistics in general you have to try and train several models to see which suits your dataset best (model benchmarking). In the end it is often a trade-off between computational costs and accuracy.
1144900	I know this is old, but this was a really infuriating change Microsoft made. I get that it is due to competing internal teams and Windows > OneNote/Office, but still... I used Win+N daily, as did a lot of people. Anyway, here's what I did to "fix the glitch": Installed AutoHotkey (Freeware scriptable key remapping software) In the default script file it creates in your Documents folder: AutoHotKey.ahk I added the following: #n::#!n That basically says: #n [Win+N] = [Win+Alt+N] Save, then hit the reload script from the tasktray menu for AutoHotkey and viola, SOLVED! Omg finally... geez that one was killin me for ages. Now reap the benefits of AutoHotkey... because holy crap that is an awesome app. I'm only 15min in, but I have already added a ton of frequently used things to it including even code blocks for when I dev Lol. I love it. Anyway, hope this helps you if still needed, and if for nothing else, the next google searcher such as myself. :)
1592398	The solution provided in this answer is yet effective for your needs even in Ubuntu 12.04. Placed here for your convenience. You can change your default folder for www content by editing the information provided inside the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file. By dropping sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and changing any occurrence of the /var/www or (maybe your case) /var/www/html and setting the folder that you wish to use. The contents of the file will look like this: <VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /home/geppettvs/www <Directory /> Options FollowSymLinks AllowOverride None </Directory> <Directory /home/geppettvs/www/> Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews AllowOverride None Order allow,deny allow from all </Directory> ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin"> AllowOverride None Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch Order allow,deny Allow from all </Directory> ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, # alert, emerg.

2178531	In this related question, I answered: A handful of compost should be about the consistency of a damp sponge. What I do is add water when I turn the pile: I turn the hose on a little bit, set it in the spot where the pile is going to be, and start shoveling material onto it. After a couple of inches of depth, I raise the hose, so the water trickles into the center of the pile. Then shovel some more, repeatedly lifting the hose every couple inches of depth. This way, the whole height of the pile gets some moisture. If it has been hot, and we haven't had any rain, I'll also dump waste water onto the pile. (E.g. soiled water from animal buckets.)
153369	The basic meaning of the root *leǵ- was "pick out". Compare e.g., from Latin, se-lect, col-lect: to collect things is to pick them out (legō) and place them together (con-). In Greek, the development seems to have been something like "pick out (information)" > "recount" > "say". If you're telling someone a story, you start by picking out the things you want to tell them. The semantic relationship is possibly a bit clearer if you think about the noun from the same root logos, which means "verbal account": an account is a collection of information that the speaker has picked out for some communicative purpose. (The reddit thread quoted in your answer is a bit misleading in that in Greek, unlike in Latin, legō hardly ever means "read", while in Latin it doesn't mean "say": the developments in the two languages were not the same, though both senses start from the idea of "picking out".)
551193	(If you know the basics, go to last paragraph and skip the introduction part) There are two types of ligands. Strong field ligands and weak field ligands. Those which only cause a small extent of crystal field splitting is called weak field ligand and those which cause large splitting is called strong field ligand. Why does crystal field splitting take place? Let's take an octahedral complex. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ point along x,y,z axis and the $t_{2g}$ orbitals point between the axis. When the 6 ligands approach along the three axes, the energy of the $e_g$ orbitals increase more than the increase in the energy of $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Hence the d-orbital splits into two. Filling each electron in $t_{2g}$ orbitals decrease energy by $0.4\Delta_0$ and filling electrons in $e_g$ increase energy by $0.6\Delta_0$ Coming back to your question, you know how electrons are filled in the orbitals (according to hund's rule of course). But how does electron pairing take place in your case? Let the energy required to pair an electron be P. Let's say there are 4 electrons. The two arrangements are one electron in each sub-orbital (no pairing) and 4 electrons all in $t_{2g}$ itself (instead of 4th electron going to $e_g$, its paired up in $t_{2g}$). In the first case, the total energy is $-0.6\Delta_0$ and in second case, its $-1.6\Delta_0+P$. So, only strong field ligands can form the second arrangement. $P$ value is constant for a given metal ion. Finally, ammonia is weak field ligand but in certain cases, it acts as a strong field ligand (example: for Cobalt). For Fe, ammonia is a weak field ligand. Hence no pairing takes place.
2197114	If that was a photo of somewhere in the UK, the answer to your question would be that any garden belonging to the houses is behind that wall; the areas of grass between the wall and the road would be owned by a municipal Council or housing association, and not by the residents of the houses. This kind of arrangement is more common in less overcrowded areas of the UK - you wouldn't find this in London other than possibly on some housing estates, for instance, but you might well see something like it in the North or in more rural areas I can't say whether this is the explanation in the USA though, but on examining the photo again, I suspect it shows the backs of the houses, not the front.
949622	I'm also using Ubuntu 10.04 and I can connect to my machines using their name. Say I have computers named ernie and bert that are on the same network: ernie:~$ ping bert.local ernie:~$ echo hello > file.txt ernie:~$ scp file.txt bert.local:~/copied-from-ernie.txt You can use this in nautilus too. Enter ssh://bert.local into the nautilus location bar in ubuntu (hit Ctrl-L to select the location bar) and hit enter. If you have different user names use ssh://username@bert.local I think you can do something similar in the Finder location bar. You have to install/enable sshd for this to work: Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install openssh-server (you may need to restart) Mac: System Preferences --> Sharing. Check the "Remote Login" box.
1042982	This was true once, but it isn't anymore. From MS-DOS # Windows command-line interface - Wikipedia: All versions of Microsoft Windows have had an MS-DOS like command-line interface (CLI). This could run many DOS and variously Win32, OS/2 1.x and Posix command line utilities in the same command-line session, allowing piping between commands. The user interface, and the icon up to Windows 2000, followed the native MS-DOS interface. Consumer Windows (up to 3.11, Win9x, WinME) ran as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) running on top of MS-DOS. With Windows 95, 98, and ME the MS-DOS part was integrated, treating both operating systems as a complete package. The command line accessed the DOS command line (usually command.com), through a Windows module (winoldap.mod). A new line of Windows, (Windows NT), boot through a kernel whose sole purpose is to load Windows. One can not run Win32 applications in the loader system in the manner that OS/2, UNIX or Consumer Windows can launch character mode sessions. So no, in every Windows from the NT family (e.g., XP, Vista, 7, 8), the command prompt and MS-DOS are visually similar, but quite different.
1248376	It depends on which windows build you are on, for me in 2018 on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.522) and also Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.165) the location is still: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\lxss The trick is when you're at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local you will not see an lxss folder (unless you happen to have unchecked "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)" in your folder options). However just append \lxss in the windows explorer address bar and it will take you to the folder. (Note I did not have a %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc or anything similar that was mentioned in Michael Bonds answer) Update Turns out there is legacy WSL which is what I had installed. Now WSL is provided via a Microsoft store app. There are versions for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and also now a few other flavors of Linux (e.g. Debian). If you want to be up-to-date you should uninstall legacy WSL and install the Microsoft store version. Where your home folder is will depend on which of these types of WSL you have installed. With the Microsoft store version it will, as mentioned in other answers, be located at: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc \LocalState\rootfs
1657693	In addition to other answers: since you want to produce a GIF file, I assume you want to display the image on a web page. If so, I would not bother converting your PNGs at all. Just google for "javascript slideshow" and use one of the millions of free scripts. Or write your own, this is really trivial. The benefits of doing it this way are: only one image is loaded in the browser at any time, the slideshow starts fast and does not consume much RAM on the user's machine. the solution scales to millions of images. Or billions, if you're patient enough to watch them all :) You can add controls to your page to pause, rewind, change the delay or go to a particular frame.
2366388	Speed varies widely by cyclist, depending on fitness, road conditions and traffic. Some of my observations (cruising speed based on a flat, paved road in good condition): 20km/h (12.4 mph) - many "occasional" cyclists ride around this speed 25km/h (15.5 mph) - most commuters 30km/h (18.6 mph) - fast commuters, slower roadies 35km/h (21.7 mph) - fast roadies any faster than that on a long flat and they're probably a racer (based on who I pass and who passes me when riding around 30km/h) Average speed will usually be slower than you think, once traffic stops and hills are factored in, especially over longer distances (like 80km). On my 21km commute I'll hit 30+ on every long stretch I can, but my average still only works out to 24km/h. For longer rides I cruise around 27-28 km/h, which is more sustainable; averaging 22-24 over a very long ride (200km) is a great pace for me.
75667	The first quote you made is from a very low-quality politics forum (GagaDaily). It looks like an ignorant misuse of "infamous". You can't use that word in a "good" way. To use "infamous", about something well-known, is to say that it is a bad thing. It means "wicked, disgraceful, evil, despicable, very wrong" etc. There is no other meaning. To use the word to mean simply "well-known" or "controversial" is an error. To call MLK's well-known speech "infamous" is to make an extremely racist and bigoted utterance. Or possibly just being ignorant. What could be called infamous is Pence's use of the speech to further the ultra-right agenda. Many people think that what Steve King said in July 2016 really was infamous. infamous adjective ​ famous for something considered bad: The list included the infamous George Drake, a double murderer. He's infamous for his bigoted sense of humour. Infamous (Cambridge Dictionary)
630418	I think the models you wrote are not incorrect, although I do wonder why you chose to treat Sites as fixed effects rather than random effects. There is nothing special about these sites, right? For example, you don't care about any differences among these particular 9 sites? If not, they are probably best considered random. 9 is not a lot of levels for a random factor, but hey, I'm sure it's expensive to get a lot of different sites. Since FAM, GEN, and SPEC are explicitly nested in your dataset (e.g., each FAM has its own unique set of GEN labels associated with it), another way to write your models would be: TWL1 <- lmer(TWL ~ SITE + (1|FAM)+(1|GEN)+(1|SPEC)) CPI1 <- lmer(CPI ~ SITE + (1|FAM)+(1|GEN)+(1|SPEC)) ACL1 <- lmer(ACL ~ SITE + (1|FAM)+(1|GEN)+(1|SPEC)) Although, as I hinted above, the models where all effects are random might make more sense: TWL1 <- lmer(TWL ~ (1|SITE)+(1|FAM)+(1|GEN)+(1|SPEC)) CPI1 <- lmer(CPI ~ (1|SITE)+(1|FAM)+(1|GEN)+(1|SPEC)) ACL1 <- lmer(ACL ~ (1|SITE)+(1|FAM)+(1|GEN)+(1|SPEC)) Or even possibly the models where sites are random and the plant categories are fixed? Not sure about these but they seem at least not-obviously-crazy to me: TWL1 <- lmer(TWL ~ FAM + GEN + SPEC + (1|SITE)) CPI1 <- lmer(CPI ~ FAM + GEN + SPEC + (1|SITE)) ACL1 <- lmer(ACL ~ FAM + GEN + SPEC + (1|SITE)) I'm not totally sure what "70% of the basal area" means, but if it implies that future replications of the study would most likely end up with the same set of plant categories (although obviously different individual plants), then maybe this last specification is defensible. But I leave that to your scientific judgment. As for whether you want to compare models using likelihood ratio tests, it really just depends on what you are wanting to know. If your goal is to talk about proportions of variation due to each of the effects in your study, the models with all random effects would probably be easiest because you can compute those proportions simply by taking the ratio of each variance component over the sum of all the variance components.
2247937	The terminology is confusing here, because "major" and "minor" have two different meanings. One meaning is "major and minor scales". The other, which is taken directly from Latin, is that "major" means "big" and "minor" means "small". A "second" means an interval between two successive note-letters in a scale - taking into account any sharps or flats in the scale, of course. In both major and minor scales, there are two different sizes of seconds - one and two semitones wide. The could just be called small seconds and big seconds, but the conventional Latinized names are minor seconds and major seconds. The same naming system applies to thirds, sixths, and sevenths as well. Fourths, fifths, and octaves are different. First, they sound different from the other intervals. Historically, the sound of 4th, 5ths and 8ves was described as "perfect" compared with "imperfect" for all the other intervals. The "perfect" intervals are the same size for almost all positions in major and minor scales. The very few exceptions (like F to B in C major and minor) are called "augmented" or "diminished", which just means "bigger than perfect" and "smaller than perfect". Final note: in the harmonic minor scale, there is one second that is three semitones wide (A flat to B natural, in C harmonic minor). The term "augmented" is used for that, i.e. "bigger than a big second". Similarly, B natural to A flat is "smaller than a small seventh", and called a "diminished" seventh.
2345014	While JACKs suggestion disguises the box well and removes the need for drywall work, it also is a potential code violation and makes it so someone in the future might not even know the box is there (it will look like a return air vent for an hvac system). That said, they make code-friendly covers called "Access Panels" explicitly for this purpose--you can even buy ones with spring clips that allow the panel to be secured directly to the drywall so you don't even have to figure out how to fasten it in place. This solution might not blend in as well as a return air grille since return air ducts in ceilings are more common, but access points to electrical boxes also shouldn't be hidden.
399428	Moaning Myrtle parents (who were Muggles, as she was a victim of the Heir of Slytherin because of that) came to Hogwarts to pick up her body. Therefore, it's technically possible. "Come on, Rubeus," said Riddle, moving yet closer. “The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow..." - Chamber of Secrets, CHAPTER THIRTEEN, The Very Secret Diary Weasley's were at Hogwarts both during HBP, and, more importantly, CoS when Ginny was taken to the Chamber: ... moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall’s office. ... It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter. - Chamber of Secrets, CHAPTER EIGHTEEN, Dobby’s Reward Montague's parents picked him up after being stuck in the Vanishing Cabinet. To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his par-ents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry (OotP) I'm sure some of the parents (Cedric's for sure) were spectators for the Tri-Wizard in GoF. While there's no canon info about parents visiting in regular circumstances, it's clear that (1) parents COULD visit, and (2) Muggle parents COULD get in. So, the actual answer is two-fer: We don't know if parent visits were allowed as part of regular school routine in the first place. Based on my experience with American schools, that seems highly discouraged, and I guess Brit schools would be the same. However, IF such visits were allowed for Wizard parents, it's 100% clear Muggle ones could be included in that (and, under a Headmaster like Dumbledore or Minerva, WOULD be included).
545657	The anode is the electrode where the oxidation reaction \begin{align} \ce{Red -> Ox + e-} \end{align} takes place while the cathode is the electrode where the reduction reaction \begin{align} \ce{Ox + e- -> Red} \end{align} takes place. That's how cathode and anode are defined. Galvanic cell Now, in a galvanic cell the reaction proceeds without an external potential helping it along. Since at the anode you have the oxidation reaction which produces electrons you get a build-up of negative charge in the course of the reaction until electrochemical equilibrium is reached. Thus the anode is negative. At the cathode, on the other hand, you have the reduction reaction which consumes electrons (leaving behind positive (metal) ions at the electrode) and thus leads to a build-up of positive charge in the course of the reaction until electrochemical equilibrium is reached. Thus the cathode is positive. Electrolytic cell In an electrolytic cell, you apply an external potential to enforce the reaction to go in the opposite direction. Now the reasoning is reversed. At the negative electrode where you have produced a high electron potential via an external voltage source electrons are "pushed out" of the electrode, thereby reducing the oxidized species $\ce{Ox}$, because the electron energy level inside the electrode (Fermi Level) is higher than the energy level of the LUMO of $\ce{Ox}$ and the electrons can lower their energy by occupying this orbital - you have very reactive electrons so to speak. So the negative electrode will be the one where the reduction reaction will take place and thus it's the cathode. At the positive electrode where you have produced a low electron potential via an external voltage source electrons are "sucked into" the electrode leaving behind the the reduced species $\ce{Red}$ because the electron energy level inside the electrode (Fermi Level) is lower than the energy level of the HOMO of $\ce{Red}$. So the positive electrode will be the one where the oxidation reaction will take place and thus it's the anode. A tale of electrons and waterfalls Since there is some confusion concerning the principles on which an electrolysis works, I'll try a metaphor to explain it. Electrons flow from a region of high potential to a region of low potential much like water falls down a waterfall or flows down an inclined plane. The reason is the same: water and electrons can lower their energy this way. Now the external voltage source acts like two big rivers connected to waterfalls: one at a high altitude that leads towards a waterfall - that would be the minus pole - and one at a low altitude that leads away from a waterfall - that would be the plus pole. The electrodes would be like the points of the river shortly before or after the waterfalls in this picture: the cathode is like the edge of a waterfall where the water drops down and the anode is like the point where the water drops into. Ok, what happens at the electrolysis reaction? At the cathode, you have the high altitude situation. So the electrons flow to the "edge of their waterfall". They want to "fall down" because behind them the river is pushing towards the edge exerting some kind of "pressure". But where can they fall down to? The other electrode is separated from them by the solution and usually a diaphragm. But there are $\ce{Ox}$ molecules that have empty states that lie energetically below that of the electrode. Those empty states are like small ponds lying at a lower altitude where a little bit of the water from the river can fall into. So every time such an $\ce{Ox}$ molecule comes near the electrode an electron takes the opportunity to jump to it and reduce it to $\ce{Red}$. But that does not mean that the electrode is suddenly missing an electron because the river is replacing the "pushed out" electron immediately. And the voltage source (the source of the river) can't run dry of electrons because it gets its electrons from the power socket. Now the anode: At the anode, you have the low altitude situation. So here the river lies lower than everything else. Now you can imagine the HOMO-states of the $\ce{Red}$ molecules as small barrier lakes lying at a higher altitude than our river. When a $\ce{Red}$ molecule comes close to the electrode it is like someone opening the floodgates of the barrier lake's dam. The electrons flow from the HOMO into the electrode thus creating an $\ce{Ox}$ molecule. But the electrons don't stay in the electrode, so to speak, they are carried away by the river. And since the river is such a vast entity (lots of water) and usually flows into an ocean, the little "water" that is added to it doesn't change the river much. It stays the same, unaltered so that everytime a floodgate gets opened the water from the barrier lake will drop the same distance.
551774	A Lewis acid is defined as an electron-pair acceptor. So for something to act as a Lewis acid, it needs to want electrons. Prime examples are $\ce{H+}$, the hardest Lewis acid around (zero polarisability, very high charge per volume ratio) and practically every metal cation out there: $\ce{Al^3+, Zn^2+, Fe^3+, Ag+}$ just to name a few. Consider boron, a rather electropositive element — it counts as a metalloid so it is somewhere between non-metals and metals. We are binding it to fluorine, the most electronegative element, and we’re doing that three times. It should be evident that there is hardly any electron density left on boron. How happy would it be, if some other atom gladly donated their electron pair to share? Now what are we going to do if there is no Lewis base around? Well, initially boron will still be there, depleted of all its valence electrons by fluorine (or nearly at least). This is where fluorine discovers its charity side: All three fluorines donate just a tad of electron density so that the baby boron in the middle will stop crying. This is what you referred to as ‘back bonding’ and Ivan calls ‘mesomeric stabilisation’. But the point is: That doesn’t help against the electron deficiency in any way, it’s more like boron’s final counter-measure against loosing electrons.
661454	In mathematics, "sparse" and "dense" often refer to the number of zero vs. non-zero elements in an array (e.g. vector or matrix). A sparse array is one that contains mostly zeros and few non-zero entries. A dense array contains mostly non-zeros. There's no hard threshold for what counts as sparse; it's a loose term, but can be made more specific. For example, a vector is $k$-sparse if it contains at most $k$ non-zero entries. Another way of saying this is that the vector's $\ell_0$ norm is $k$. The usage of these terms in the context of neural networks is similar to their usage in other fields. In the context of NNs, things that may be described as sparse or dense include the activations of units within a particular layer, the weights, and the data. One could also talk about "sparse connectivity", which refers to the situation where only a small subset of units are connected to each other. This is a similar concept to sparse weights, because a connection with zero weight is effectively unconnected. "Sparse array" can also refer to a class of data types that are efficient for representing arrays that are sparse. This is a concept within the domain of programming languages. It's related to, but distinct from the mathematical concept.
747027	It would help to know what motivates the question, to make sure I'm getting at what you are trying to find out, but here goes: The advisors I have known would wait for the student to bring up a health situation before talking about it. They would consider the overweight in conjunction with other aspects of the student's well-being. Being overweight by itself wouldn't be a concern. If it were accompanied by symptoms of pre-diabetes, heart disease, OCD, depression, etc., then the advisor would be concerned about the big picture (including, but not limited to, the weight problem). The concern would be about the student, not about the group. The gender of the student would be irrelevant. This is my assessment, regarding the advisors I have personally known.
40614	As I understand them, there are some connotations that you might not know as a learner. I have provided pictures of what they could mean, without further context. Cycling. Biking. (Short for mountain biking.) I think there is also the possibility of understanding biking to mean riding motorcycles, the Harley-Davidson types. Ride bicycles. This is what I personally imagine: casual, roadside riding. Ride bikes. Often means 3, but can also mean motorcycle riding. (Motorcycles are sometimes called bikes.) Now 1-4 are what I imagine without context. I suspect you mean something along the lines of 3. So if your audience expects bike-riding, like in 3, then I believe using "Let’s go biking/ride bicycles/ride bikes." should all work fine. I think I would personally say "Let's go bike-riding." Again, it could mean motorcycle, but if your audience expects something like 3, then it should work fine. Bicycle-riding works too.
632897	The real difference between OLS and GLS is the assumptions made about the error term of the model. In OLS we (at least in CLM setup) assume that $Var(u)=\sigma^2 I$, where I is the identity matrix - such that there are no off diagonal elements different from zero. With GLS this is no longer the case (it could be, but then GLS = OLS). With GLS we assume that $Var(u) = \sigma^2 \Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is the variance-covariance matrix. Many text books introduce GLS with WLS, which is the GLS function that eliminates heteroskedasticity (or tries to). This means that the usual t/F statistics can be valid for the GLS estimation, but not for the OLS. This is less troublesome today, since you can just compute robust variance estimates and base you inference on that - same as you normally would. This implies that difference between OLS and GLS is in the variance of the estimates. And the real reason, to choose, GLS over OLS is indeed to gain asymptotic efficiency (smaller variance for n $\rightarrow \infty$. It is important to know that the OLS estimates can be unbiased, even if the underlying (true) data generating process actually follows the GLS model. If GLS is unbiased then so is OLS (and vice versa). You can very easily proof this, but basically the assumptions for consistency/unbiasedness do not rely on the variance of the estimates at all. A more subtle point is that, unless you know the actual GLS function, it is not unbiased but only consistent. I would therefore argue that choosing between OLS and GLS based on estimates and $R^2$ is the wrong way to think about it. The estimates of both OLS and GLS should be close to one another, if not numerically then in the size of the “impact”. If they are not, then it would most likely indicate that you have a function form misspecification(s), of that you have left out variables. I don’t know whether or not, excluding the GLS weights covariates is justified in your case - but perhaps it worth trying to include them in the OLS estimation and see what happens? It might make the reader less “suspicious” about your conclusion (but this is pure speculation on my part).
1122600	Format - applies to files Protocol - applies to communications In both instances you are talking about the index of various bytes in a stream and what they are supposed to represent. Protocol can get more involved, as many protocols work in a "request-response" fashion where the client issues a well-formed request, and then a server responds with a well-formed response. So there may be different schema for request, response. Requests may change client or server "state" and thus the schema may be different again given a particular state. File formats are typically always following the same schema unless they are a different version, though they can be complex as well - later bytes in a file format may depend on earlier bytes (the .PST file format or the Windows Registry hive format, for example).
2228273	Chemically, they're very different, having to do with carbon chain lengths, the discussion about which will not help you decide. @WedaPashi gave an awesome answer, so, I'll add to it by saying this: First, you must know your stove; I assume you're asking about backpacking stoves who use jets, not generators. If so, the denser fuels (us-kero/uk-paraffin, diesel) require smaller jet holes and shorter jets, which carburate with a lower air mix, whereas the medium fuels (coleman/white gas, gasoline/petrol, aviation fuel) use a slightly larger jet hole, and a slightly longer jet which allows more air mixture. Finally, the lightest fuels (propane, butane, and mixes of each) require larger holes and longest jets, as these fuels are under higher pressures and mix more with air. The reasoning has to do with needing more oxygen to combine with denser chains in the fuels, and you need more oxygen for the lighter fuels. That doesn't help you choose a stove, it just explains the differences, which answers the first part of your question. Next, you need to know local ordinances or laws. For example, some places forbid use of liquid gas (white gas, gasoline, diesel, kero, alcohol, etc) and prefer you to use LG - propane or butane - or fuel tabs (or wood). Places with high water tables or many waterways tend not to allow these liquid fuels, to mitigate the danger of a spill. Others forbid use of canisters, due to litter concerns. And you may be subject to rules within your group - the boy scouts, for example - who explicitly forbid use of alcohol, due to the fact that it burns too cleanly, and flames are difficult to see. So from a practical point of view, the heavier fuels (white gas, gasoline, diesel, kero) is best (or required) used in cold weather. Next, cost could also be a factor in your choice of stove. Prices for each tend to favor the canisters, as you can get cheap butane stoves for about $8 from Etekcity, which are surprisingly durable, light, and - oddly - almost too small. They fit inside the concave impression at the bottom of the fuel canister. The heavy gas stoves by Optimus and MSR are quite durable also, and tend to have the ability to burn a variety of different fuels, but they cost $100 and up - the new optimus optiful cost $180 and literally burns anything except alcohol. Next, consider the safety and cleanliness of the fuels you'll be burning. If your stove burns white gas (coleman) it will also burn gasoline (petrol) and aviation fuel. If your stove burns kerosene (paraffin) it will generally burn diesel. But that doesn't mean you should burn all these fuels: gasoline/petrol, diesel, and aviation fuel - they're notoriously poisonous and dirty. Gas/petrol is also explosive, and if you spill it, you're gonna smell it for days - it won't evaporate away due to the mixtures added to it. Kerosene is also a dirty fuel, but once it gets started, it burns relatively cleanly. So, you should prime these stoves with alcohol to mitigate the soot build up. However, kero is an extremely stable fuel and isn't as flammable as the others. Still deciding on a stove or fuel? The stove mechanics also makes a difference. For the multi-fuel stoves, you almost always have to change the jets. Kero/diesel, gas/coleman, propane/butane are the three jets you'll need. But here I question the need for such a stove: carry what you need for the fuel you'll need. If you think you need to burn everything, then by all means, bring all the jets and tools to exchange the jets, but that makes the trip a little more complicated. (Unless you go with the expensive Optimus Optifuel, which requires NO jet changes). But you still have to worry about clogged jets, and field maintenance on these delicate things can be a menace. One lost part, and you're screwed. My advice is to bring the stove with least amount of fuels you'll need and can bring. Don't bring the one which can burn aviation fuel if you won't be anywhere near an airport. Remember, in an emergency, you can always burn a wood fire, no matter the stove which ran out of fuel. For what it's worth, this is a great read: FAQ - Technical details on Stoves EDIT: More reading material: What's the difference between gasoline, kerosene, diesel, etc?

2366385	How long is a piece of string? Your speed is totally dependent on your surface, equipment, bike type ... and you! I keep a record of most of my training ride (for the last few years with GPS, but summary data going back further) and compete with myself. If you're interested in what you should/could be doing, maybe liaise with a local club. On my commute my rolling average with lots of braking and accelerating, is a good mph or two lower than training rides (further, but quieter roads) with race pace being another mph or two higher; cyclo-cross and off-road is completely terrain dependent so your mileage really will vary enormously And if you have professional road aspirations, you'll want to average at least 25-27mph.
19810	Another use of swag in the same story: Obama likewise seems to think that a bit of swag, plus a public taunt, aimed at Putin when the former KGB man is down on his luck will have the desired geopolitical effect. The word actually means what the dictionary definitions, including the one posted by CopperKettle, say it means. However, sometimes authors are unaware of what words actually mean (how other people use them). If the author is using swag as short for swagger he is either using it in error or trying to use it to have two meanings at once. In either case his usage is so esoteric it escapes the common reader. A third possibility is that I am unaware that swag is short for swagger.
442051	Darth Vader is Kylo Ren's maternal grandfather. A maternal grandparent is someone who is your mom's parent. Your paternal grandparents are your father's parents. Your mom's parents are your maternal grandparents.(source) Another way of saying it is "my grandfather on my mother's side" (or maternal grandfather) vs "my grandfather on my father's side" (or paternal grandfather). You are correct that Vader is not Kylo's paternal grandfather (as that whould be Han's dad, and Vader is not Han's dad), but Vader is still Kylo's maternal grandfather (as that would be Leia's dad, and Vader is Leia's dad1). Here's a chart I made to help make it abundantly clear: 1 We know Vader is Leia's father from Return of the Jedi, when Luke learns that Leia is his twin sister. LUKE: Leia's my sister! KENOBI: Your insight serves you well.
1070763	As noted in the other answers, it's hot-plug, as per the specification (most recently freely available version is 1.3a, references are to that version here). Damage may be physical, or electrical. Physically, type A connectors should be good for over 10,000 insertions (as good as micro-USB), see §4.1.6 Connector Mechanical Performance. Since it's possible to get imperfect (simultaneous) mating of all pins, one side may not initialise correctly during hot-plugging, that ought not cause damage. HDMI is robust against shorting any combination of pins or connection (§4.2.11 Robustness Requirements). §8.5 Hot Plug Detect Signal describes the connection and HPD process. There is a dedicated pin for hot-plug, the HPD pin, damage to this will cause problems (but you can say that about any pin). After HPD is asserted, an E-EDID data exchange should occur. Warnings that come with HDMI devices or cables instructing you to power-off before connecting may be intended to minimise electrical discharges and other effects due to potential differences between grounds (the cause of "ground loops"). In my experience, aside from old or bad wiring, the main sources of ground loops are cables originating from different providers: cable, phone and electricity. Ethernet with metalized 8P8C (RJ45) connectors could also cause problems (more about ethernet and grounding). Low quality SMPS (switched-mode power supplies) in cheap electrical equipment are another problem (earth leakage, dubious isolation, undesirable modes of failure). It may be prudent to interconnect devices with different input sources while the devices are powered off, but still plugged in so that they are grounded. So to answer your question: if your TV has a direct connection to an analogue coax cable provider, there might be a ground loop which could in principle cause damage to circuitry when making connections. If your laptop is not plugged in to a charger (or ethernet) this is less likely to occur. One additional consideration might arise due to HDCP (content protection) – when you have more than two HDMI-capable devices the order in which you plug things in may cause different end results. Whether that conflicts with your understanding of hot-pluggable is up to you ;-)
1165763	The internet is filled with conflicting information because a lot of it applies to different scenarios. General background: Firstly, there's a paired device and a connected device and then an actively communicating device. Your links above confuse these and no distinction, but there is a difference in functionality. A device can be paired, but not connected. Similarly, it can be connected but not transmitting. Think of a paired device as a saved wireless network that you're not connected to. Then there are host devices and client devices. This is a generalization, but consider PCs, mobile phones, and tablets (and consoles) to be hosts, and headsets, controllers, mice, keyboards, etc. to be clients. Then there's profiles, a profile indicating a type of connection (e.g. audio, HID, etc.) With that in mind, the following apply: In general, host devices support up to 7 simultaneously connected devices and a practically unlimited number of paired. Host devices are like a wireless router - you can connect many different devices at a time. Client devices typically support a limited number of pairings, anywhere between 1 and 5, and only one single connection. They act like a wireless client - you can save many different networks but only connect to one at a time. Some profiles only support one connection at a time on some devices - for example, some Bluetooth speakers can only connect to one computer at a time. A phone for example usually can only connect to one HSP (headset) at a time but can connect multiple HIDs (keyboards, mice, etc.). Also, to explain/clarify some of your links/references: All Bluetooth adapters can support 7 devices, period. Mostly true - the standards only allow up to seven simultaneous connections on a normal device. But you can pair any number of devices. You can hook up 7 devices, but only if they're all different types of devices. False, but in some scenarios, you cannot simultaneously use two devices with the same Bluetooth profile. This generally applies to audio devices only (i.e. headsets) which may be all that some people are familiar with. For example, a phone can connect to one headset, or one music stream, or one of each, but not two headsets or two speakers. A PC can, however, connect to many phones at a time. You can hook up unlimited devices, no restrictions. (source - a Bluetooth Dongle tech-support) False. You can usually pair unlimited devices on a host, but you cannot connect to them all simultaneously (again, think of the number of saved wireless networks, that aren't all connected at the same time) Only devices that support "multipoint functionality" can have multiple hooked up at once, and the choice of adapter doesn't make a difference. Partly true. This only applies to client devices, such as headsets, controllers, keyboards, etc.. These limited devices can only connect to one host at a time if they do not have multipoint. A host can accept multiple clients even if those clients do not support multipoint. Only Bluetooth 4.1 adapters support multiple devices. False. No idea where he got this from, it's plain rubbish. You can only use one device per Bluetooth adapter. False. Pretty much everything in that entire statement is wrong. So the final answer is yes, you can connect four controllers (clients) to one adapter (host) at a time. Even without the above information, it's fairly obvious as per @oldmud0's answer, if [controller] uses Bluetooth, then how does the PlayStation establish a connection to all 4 controllers with a single radio [if Bluetooth didn't support it]?
2372603	Randonneuring or Audax riding is about riding audaciously long distances for the pleasure of riding audaciously long distances. (www.audax.org.au) One method involves riding at 22.5km/h (14mi/h) in a peleton for up to 1000km. Another method involves riding at any pace above 15km/h (9.32mi/h) (up to 600km) or 13.33km/h (8.32mi/h) (1000 / 1200km). I would suggest that the reasonable speeds for very long distance riding are 15km/h total average including breaks up to 600km, or 13.33km/h for 1000/1200km/h rides. As a result I feel good when I make 15km/h of actual time when riding long distances, and try to improve my riding so that I'd be able to make 15km/h of actual time including sleep for longer distances.
2382959	Assuming your terrain is relatively flat: Average cyclists will be 10-15 km/h, so that's 8.5 and 6 minutes. I've walked past a grannie cyclist while out exercising my dog, so she would be doing under 6 km/h and at that speed would take 21 minutes to get to the station. A fast road bike does 40 km/h and the pros can do 50-55 km/h sustained, so that's 2.1 minutes and 1.5 minutes respectively. The world land speed record on a bike is well above 130 km/h and at that speed you'd be at the station in ~38 seconds. The formula is ( Distance in km ) / ( Speed im km/h ) * 60 returning a time in minutes. This assumes no stopping for lights or traffic or crossing.
326	The first and most important point to note it that it's very informal (more so than using contractions such as my it's there, for example). The main reason for using it at all stems from that "extreme informality". It normally conveys a relaxed attitude on the part of the speaker. Depending on context, it can be more or less emphatic than "No". You only use nope to mean [my answer is] "No" – it never replaces no in any other contexts. And you wouldn't normally use it where you want to be very emphatic (shouting "No!" at the top of your voice). Which example illustrates a defining characteristic – "Nope" isn't often followed by an exclamation mark! Finally, I'd echo John Lawler's words: "nope" occurs only as a one-word answer to Y/N questions. That's to say, a written form such as: "Nope I don't want to" doesn't look right. We expect a full stop (or at the very least a comma) after "Nope" because in real-world speech there always would be a pause there. But that doesn't happen with: "No I don't want to!" because it's perfectly possible to speak those words without pausing appreciably after "No" (without necessarily placing extra stress on "don't", either; I just italicised it as one possible enunciation).
