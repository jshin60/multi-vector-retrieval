589	"You too" is an abbreviation of a repeat of the sender's statement, for example: Merry Christmas! [Merry Christmas to] You too! This is entirely valid spoken English (it's very informal in written English), but be careful of when you don't want to return the greeting in its exact form. For example, the following is fine when both you and your friend are heading home from work: Have a safe trip home! You too! But the previous conversation is wrong (but usually obviously and inoffensively wrong) if the first person is not travelling home, for instance if the second person were leaving the first's house after a visit. In such a circumstance, one would normally have to think of an alternative response, for example: Have a safe trip home! Thanks! Have a great evening!
387344	A Warren (also Holds in earlier times that you'll get to in later books) are places (worlds/dimensions). They have distinct geographies, may be inhabited, have occupants (i.e. creatures that live in them), and are generally ruled by a god (or sometimes something else). Mages draw power from Warrens (by opening a mental doorway/window to them), but they are also able to physically enter them, travel through them (interacting with any inhabitants), and exit somewhere else. Mages can take non-mages on these travels, and occasionally a non-mage will enter a Warren for some reason. In Memories of Ice, you'll find out that: Warrens were created in some way from the flesh and blood of the Elder God K'rul, and have a strong connection (possibly sourcing power from) dragons (Eleint). Dragons typically inhabit Warrens.
432766	In the comics, Barry Allen has been shown to run faster than light, as per @Keen's answer to this related question. Exactly how fast has never really been measured -- as far as I know, they've never tried to apply the Star Trek "warp" scale to Barry. In the DC universe, there are five "speed barriers" (really, critical velocities): the sound barrier, the light barrier, the time barrier, the dimension barrier, and the Speed Force barrier. Barry is one of the very few people who can break through all five barriers, meaning he can run significantly faster than light -- fast enough to travel into the Speed Force itself. (In general, he rarely moves faster than a few Mach levels, because it causes major problems for his surroundings.) In the TV show, we just don't know. In the Flash episode "Legends of Today", Harrison Wells and Caitlyn Snow actually discuss Barry's top speed so far. Caitlyn claims that Barry was travelling at something around Mach 2 when he time traveled. (We have to assume, then, that the time travel is an effect of the Speed Force itself, and not a side-effect of supra-light travel.) Wells claims that Zoom is "at least 10 times" as fast as that, and that Barry will have to get himself up to that point to face Zoom. I think we can expect that as the season progressed, Barry will struggle to become faster than he has been up to this point, but there's no indication where that speed increase will happen.
553756	The pattern is better expressed this way: Row 1: 2 elements Row 2: 2+6 elements Row 3: 2+6 elements Row 4: 2+6+10 elements Row 5: 2+6+10 elements Row 6: 2+6+10+14 elements Row 7: 2+6+10+14 elements The reason comes down to how the electrons fill the available energy levels. The thing that differentiates one element from another is the proton number, and each time a proton is added and a new element defined it requires one more electron to neutralise the charge. That electron naturally occupies the lowest available energy level in the atom. The energy levels available are defined by the quantum state, including the quantum numbers $n, l,$ and $m_l$. $n$ is the principle quantum number and relates to the period the element is in, or the shell. $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number which defines the sub shell s, p, d, f, of which there are $n$ subshells whose values are $l=0,\dots {n-1}$. The magnetic quantum number $m_l$ further subdivides the subshell into orbitals, of which there are $2l+1$ orbitals whose values are $m_l=-l,\dots {+l}$. subshell number of orbitals subshell label l value (number of ml values) electron capacity s 0 1 2 p 1 3 6 d 2 5 10 f 3 7 14 Each orbital (i.e. each value of $m_l$) may contain 2 electrons The available quantum numbers are: n l values (subshells) ml values total shell electron capacity 1 0 (s) 0 2 2 0,1 (s,p) -1,0,1 2+6 3 0,1,2 (s,p,d) -2,-1,0,1,2 2+6+10 4 0,1,2,3 (s,p,d,f) -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 2+6+10+14 The pattern is there, but it doesn't seem to match up because by row 7 you would have 98 electrons in the shell and might expect the row to contain 98 elements. This is not the case! The energy levels for the $l$ values with large deviations from $0$ (i.e. orbitals with high angular momentum) become increasingly far apart, so even though 3d orbitals exist in the third row, they are so much higher in energy than the 3p orbitals that they are higher even than the 4s orbitals. This happens again in row 4 where 4f orbitals are so much higher in energy than 4d orbitals, they are even higher than 5s. The different in energy is not always so large in specific cases, so there are examples where bonding or ligands or symmetry cause the energy levels to switch around, but otherwise the trend is true. If they can produce (or discover) some elements in the next row, we might expect to see the 5g shell finally start to get filled and have a new block in the table, but realistically it doesn't look like they will be stable atoms. I think I'm missing the reason why we arrange the elements into this table in the first place. The periodic table is arranged so that all elements in the same column have the same number of outer electrons. This is useful because elements with the same outer shell configuration of electrons react in similar ways, so they are grouped together in columns. This has the effect of creating 'periods' that begin with a reactive metal and end with an inert gas. Row 1 has two elements, and it's special in a way because it's the first in the series. Hydrogen has 1 electron, and a maximum capacity of 2 electrons. This means it behaves in a similar way as other elements that only have 1 electron in their outer shell (group 1), and also in a similar way to elements that only need 1 more electron to complete their outer shell (group 7). Where do we position it then? Often it is placed somewhere in the middle. Helium then has a full outer shell, which means it has many similarities to other elements with a full outer shell and goes in group 8 (or group 0) on the right. Edit: The alternative period table that you mention, the left-hand version, is laid out so as you read it from left to right you fill up the orbitals. This takes in to account that situation I describe where 3d orbitals are higher than 4s, and using this left-hand table you clearly see that. However this alternative table does not allow you to easily read the valance shell configuration like the Mendelev one does. Other types of table highlight different kinds of properties or relationships, which can be more useful in certain situations. The labels on the left (1s; 2s; 2p 3s; etc) relate to the outer subshell in that row, so Carbon is in the "2p" section of that chart while Magnesium is in the "3s" section on the same row.

1263601	I just needed to find /etc/environment using Ubuntu 16.04 looking into Windows 10 NTFS storage. I found it here: C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu16.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\etc\environment I changed /mnt/c/ to C:\ for Windows nomenclature. I also changed all occurrences of / to \ for same reason. You need to replace USER_NAME with your Windows User Name. I had to use sudo -H Nautilus to get permissions to view the User Files stored in WSL. NEVER update your Linux files in WSL using a Windows application. It will corrupt your Linux data. From the Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) side the nomenclature would be: $ sudo cat /mnt/c/Users/USER_NAME/AppData/Local/Packages/CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu16.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc/LocalState/rootfs/etc/environment PATH="/mnt/e/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games" export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=Yes export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
2372677	Average speed is extremely dependant on: Your fitness (main factor) Weather (particularly wind) Road surface quality Interruptions like traffic lights, dog-walkers on bike-lanes Accumulated fatigue over multiple days How hilly the terrain is (although this can be balanced out by the faster descent) As you mentioned, best way to see is using a GPS and seeing how fast you go.. I've found over the course of about 6-months of riding, my average speed over long rides is around the average of my shorter rides (I'm classifying "long" as around 150-200km, and "short" as maybe 30-80km) For example, here is a plot of my distances vs average speed: (the axis's are in km/h and km) The >50km rides averaging 25-30km/h are mostly group rides. Ignoring those, beyond about 80km begin to converge to an average of 20km/h (although at 80km I've ranged from about 15-25km/h, but this includes when I just started riding..) These numbers are all specific to me, and even still they vary (particularly over time): These averages are spread over a few different bikes (start to April was on a hybrid bike, April to mid May was on one road bike, and the rest was on a different road bike) - but, the spikes are almost all related to either terrain (there's a large dip in July related to a Strava hill-climbing challenge), fatigue (the dip in August was another Strava challenge, to cycle long distances over consecutive days), or other factors mentioned above Sorry for the rather rambly answer, but it hopefully conveys that average speed depends on a lot of factors, and it's hard to give a specific answer
2395052	Nipple wrench flat sizes don't correspond to spoke gauge in as clean or universal of a way as you're suggesting. This depends a little on where you are in the world (and in history), but 2mm aka 14g spokes are by far the most common for bicycles, and there are three different common size nipples associated with them: 0.127", 0.130", and 0.136". (These correspond respectively with the black, green, and red spoke wrenches that several tool companies use.) Of these, the 0.127" wrench flat size is the standard one for 2.0mm spoke nipples by all the modern premium quality spoke makers (DT, Sapim, Wheelsmith, Marwi), and the other two are used seemingly at random by various lower-tier spoke/nipple producers. Nipples for 1.8mm/15g spokes also almost always have the 0.127" wrench flat size. 2.3mm/13g spoke nipples can have either the 0.136" size or one of the more "oversize" standards like 0.156". So there is no 1:1 mapping, especially because looking back into history there can be found any number of now-unusual permutations. The gauges listed on ring-type spoke wrenches are arbitrary and outmoded in actual use even if once they were based on some kind of real system. Also, spoke wrenches in shop use get a lot of reps and do develop slop and eventually wear out.
553445	The D-L system corresponds to the configuration of the molecule: spatial arrangement of its atoms around the chirality center. While (+) and (-) notation corresponds to the optical activity of the substance, whether it rotates the plane of polarized light clockwise (+) or counterclockwise (-). D-L system tells us about the relative configuration of the molecule, compared to the enantiomers of glyceraldehyde as the standard compound. Compounds with the same relative configuration as (+)-glyceraldehyde are assigned the D prefix, and those with the relative configuration of (-)-glyceraldehyde are given the L prefix. It's kind of another way to tell the configuration of molecules beside the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog convention (R/S system), with little difference. (D-L system labels the whole molecule, while R/S system labels the absolute configuration of each chirality center.) In short, the D-L system doesn't have direct connection to (+)/(-) notation. It only relates the stereochemistry of the compound with that of glyceraldehyde, but says nothing about its optical activity. We may have compound with same relative configuration as (+)-glyceraldehyde (thus, it's given the D prefix), yet it rotates the polarized light counterclockwise (-), such as D-(-)-ribose. And also, don't confuse the D-L system with d- and l- naming. d- and l- is the exact same with (+) and (-) notation. Additional explanation D-L system (also called Fischer–Rosanoff convention) is mainly used for naming α-amino acids and sugars. It compares the relative configurations of molecules to the enantiomers of glyceraldehyde. This convention is still in common use today. Rosanoff in 1906 selected the enantiomeric glyceraldehydes as the point of reference[1]; any sugar derivable by chain lengthening from what is now known as (+)-glyceraldehyde (or named D-glyceraldehyde) belongs to the D series. In other words, we used a D to designate the sugars that degrade to (+)-glyceraldehyde and an L for those that degrade to (-)-glyceraldehyde. In assigning the D and L configurations of sugars, we could direcly look for the OH group of the bottom asymmetric carbon in the Fischer projection. If it's located on the right, we designate it with D, and vice versa, since they would have the same relative configurations with glyceraldehyde for the bottom asymmetric carbon.

588553	First of all, a CI for a given confidence percentage (e.g.95%) means, for all practical purposes (though technically it is not correct) that you are confident that the true value is in the interval. If this is interval is "narrow" (note that this can only be regarded in a relative fashion, so, for comparison with what follows, say it is 1 unit wide), it means that there is not much room to play: whichever value you pick in that interval is going to be close to the true value (because the interval is narrow), and you are quite certain of that (95%). Compare this to a relatively wide 95% CI (to match the example before, say it is 100 units wide): here, you are still 95% certain that the true value will be within this interval, yet that doesn't tell you very much, since there are relatively many values in the interval (about a factor 100 as opposed to 1 - and I ask, again, of purists to ignore the simplification). Typically, you are going to need a bigger interval when you want to be 99% certain that the true value is in it, than when you only need to be 95% certain (note: this may not be true if the intervals are not nested), so indeed, the more confidence you need, the broader the interval you will need to pick. On the other hand, you are more certain with the higher confidence interval. So, If I give you 2 intervals of the same width, and I say one is a 95% CI and the other is a 99% CI, I hope you will prefer the 99% one. In this sense, 99% CIs are more accurate: you have less doubt that you will have missed the truth.
943048	AFAIK, focus on OS X is dictated by the application doing the stealing as well as the application which currently has focus (it is possible, for example, to program an "autocratic" UI application, such as a game). That said, it may be practical in your situation to modify the focus-stealing app itself. Inside the app bundle is an Info.plist. Add the LSUIElement key and set it to 1. This will (should) remove all trace of UI or dock icon, though it will still be visible in activity monitor. If you need to interact with this app's UI on a regular basis, this probably isn't practical. It might be just what you need, however, if you don't need to do more than launch it. Assuming it works with that app, that is.
1043023	Your friend is right. MS-DOS is/was an Operating System (Microsoft Disk Operating System is what the acronym stands for.) The UI for DOS is called a (the) command prompt. The first few versions of Windows ran on top of DOS (making them technically operating environments, though I'm not sure anybody makes that distinction anymore), but later OSes, starting with the NT Kernel, didn't - DOS was gone. However, people still needed the functionality provided by the command prompt, and instead of command.com we got command.exe (and these days cmd.exe), which when run gives us a command prompt. But, that's not the only (nor anywhere near the first) command prompt that people have used. Command Prompts are also called Shells, and Unix has many, and the commands are different and often very powerful. Speaking of Power, Microsoft has created a new command prompt for Windows called PowerShell which is incredibly powerful and interesting. See Wikipedia for more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Operating_System_Command-Line_Interfaces
1255297	As an alternative to @harrymc's answer, you can also use the Windows command line tool BCDEDIT to configure the Windows Boot Manager from an elevated command prompt. The following instructions assume you are booted into Windows 7. to open an elevated command prompt, press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then type: cmd /admin to list the Boot Manager settings, type: bcdedit To remove another entry, take note of the entry's identifier hex string (e.g. {00000000-0000-0000-000000000000}) and type: bcdedit /delete {00000000-0000-0000-000000000000} /remove To rename the description of the {current} entry to "Windows 7", type: bcdedit /set {current} description "Windows 7" If you wish to not display the Boot Manager on boot if you only have one entry, you can use this command: bcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no
1261341	They're not the same! Apparently lots of people don't realise that the DOS Prompt, and the Windows Command Prompt are not the same thing. They're actually two different programs - COMMAND.COM and CMD.EXE respectively. Know Your Command Prompts Firstly due to differences in the platform (DOS vs Windows) and interpreter (command.com vs cmd.exe), there will be obvious dissimilarities like DOS runs in fullscreen without a windowed mode, so no mode con:cols=COL lines=ROW command to resize the console, and no title command DOS doesn't support multitasking, multiuser, registry, permissions, long file names, symlinks/hardlinks, network, Unicode, dynamic disks and advanced volumes support... so no tools to manage those But there are also major differences in the capabilities and syntax of internal commands between command.com and cmd.exe, as well as some external tools in the two environments. In MS-DOS there are No functions, code blocks () and local scopes which mean for, if... must be followed by a single command on the same line no exit /b or goto :eof no setlocal and endlocal goto can only jump to a label, call can only start another batch file commands can't be grouped together like ( command1 command2 ) >output.txt No escape character ^. Printing special characters would be a pain, and no possibility of running multiline commands No special formats of if no if cmdextversion and if defined no numeric and case-insensitive string comparison if [/i] string1 compare-op string2 No command history and command argument completion No indirect expansion (e.g. call set %%var%suffix%=string) of variables and no delayed expansion (e.g. echo !var%suffix%!) No advanced string manipulation no ~xxxV variable support no substring %variable:~num1,num2% or string replacement support %variable:str=newstr% No partial variable name matching for set, and no set /a so you can't do arithmetic no set /p which means reading user input is a pain no set "var=value" syntax No %* for the whole command line No for /d, for /r or for /l. No for /f so reading input from files is also difficult. The only form of for in DOS is FOR %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters] No findstr, and find doesn't support Unicode No special environment variables like %CD% %DATE% %TIME% %RANDOM% %ERRORLEVEL% %CMDEXTVERSION% %CMDCMDLINE% %HIGHESTNUMANODENUMBER% Limited directory changing ability No pushd/popd No cd /d. Also no cd path with spaces and cd "path with spaces" due to the lack of long file name support No color No forfiles No assoc (because there are no GUI and files must be opened manually from command line, so no file association is needed) A lot of useful external commands in Windows like where, sort, more (in some DOS versions), choice... are also missing in DOS And this is what MS' Rich Turner said Also, Cmd != MS-DOS! I also want to point out a common misconception perpetuated by articles like the ones above: Cmd <> MS-DOS! In FACT: Microsoft last shipped a "new" version of MS-DOS (v8.0 in Windows ME), on September 16th, 2000 - 16 years ago (as of this writing)!! MS-DOS was an operating system (albeit a relatively simple OS by today's standards) whose primary user-interface was a command-line shell, until Windows 3.x & 9.x arrived and ran on/around MS-DOS MS-DOS' command-line shell's scripting language was relatively terse and moderately powerful, but lacked many of the richer, and more advanced features we enjoy in modern-day PowerShell, Bash, etc. While later versions of MS-DOS grew in sophistication and added/replaced some older assembly with new code written in 'C', much of MS-DOS remained written in x86 assembly for efficiency, and because it was the only way at the time to gain access to many hardware devices and peripherals. This made MS-DOS non-portable to non-x86 CPU's. If you're so inclined, you can actually download the source code for MS-DOS v1.1 and v2.0 to see just how much of the earlier versions of MS-DOS were written in x86 assembly (hint: pretty much all of it)! https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/rumors-of-cmds-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/ Further reading Limitations of MS-DOS 6.22 Commands and Their Availability From MS-DOS 6.22 through Windows 8 New (and Removed) Commands in Windows 8 How do modern .bat files differ from old MS DOS .bat files? Windows batch files: .bat vs .cmd? cmd.exe: comparison with MS-DOS Prompt A command line interface is not a "DOS prompt" In conclusion, functionality-wise they may be a little bit similar, but otherwise hugely different
1369213	There will be resistors on some levels. If you like ICs, you can buy IC which contains multiple resistors: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/4604X-101-103LF/4604X-101-103LF-ND/3593680 Or you could use fixed-gain amplifier which has resistors + amplifier in one package. But this will be an overkill, as your output is already from amplifier, plus most fixed-gain amplifiers have gain > 1 Or you can use ADC which takes -10V..+10V range and returns I2C data such as MAX127/MAX128. Or you could just connect amplifier directly to Arduino. Output will only exceed 5V if temperature is > 590C. What is the max temperature of the thing you are trying to measure?
1814979	If you run ipconfig /all, it probably shows something like this near the top: DNS Suffix Search List: example.com If you just want to resolve names without having to type the domain, i'd make it look like this (i.e. list all of your domains here): DNS Suffix Search List: example.com subdomain.example.com Now when your computer tries to resolve a "short" name like mysite, first it will try mysite.example.com (since that's the first domain in the search list), and if it can't resolve that, it will try mysite.subdomain.example.com. Of course, you can order the domains any way you want. If you have a Windows 2003 domain, then you'll probably want to configure the DNS search list via group policy so that you don't have to configure it manually on every machine.
2411996	Your problem is not the airbag, it's you. You aren't taking a rational approach to risk. This not to insult you, because humans generally are very bad at taking a rational approach to risk - if NASA can screw up risk management (most notably on Challenger) then anyone can. :) You won't find anything in the news to say it's "perfectly safe" or even "close", because that's not news. "Safety feature saves thousands of lives a year" is not a news story. "Safety feature goes wrong once and causes minor injuries" is a news story. But you're following the perfectly normal human characteristic of assuming visibility equals importance, and that's a bad assumption. In this case, it could quite literally be a fatal assumption for you and your passengers. I'm afraid you're describing a classic case of "a little information is a dangerous thing". You've absorbed that there's a minuscule risk in one direction, so that a few people a year suffer minor injuries, and you've absorbed the concept of an airbag being "a small bomb". But you're missing the concept of what happens to the human body when you crash at speed, and that hundreds of people at day crash at speed, and walk away because of airbags. You're also assuming you are capable of "driving more carefully". The statistics are pretty good on how nearly everyone thinks they're better than average at driving - and clearly 50% of people saying that are wrong! Even if you are, being careful doesn't protect you against external problems - what happens when you hit a patch of oil on the corner? Or what happens if someone else crosses into your lane and wipes you out? Being more careful doesn't provide any protection against that. If you only drive at 20mph then crack on with taking out your airbags. You're not going fast enough to need them. If you ever drive at more than 20mph though, you'd better believe they'll save your life. I'm prepared to bet you do drive at more than 20mph. The one exception to this is if your passenger is a child. Airbags are designed to blow out where an adult's head and body would be, but that's not going to work out well for a kid. It works out even less well if your kid is in a rear-facing seat, when the seat takes the full force in entirely the wrong place. Most cars do allow you to disable the passenger side airbag, and those that don't, there's some kind of transponder which disables it if there's a child seat fitted.
492282	Many photographers (especially those with full frame sensors or 35mm film cameras) opt for a 50mm prime lens because it is considered 'normal', i.e. not wide-angle or telephoto. Because these lenses are so popular, they are also produced on a relatively large scale, which also makes them cheaper than other lenses of the same speed. With that said, there is probably a deeper underlying question to be answered: Why is a 50mm lens considered 'normal'? There are actually a few factors that contribute to this. If we look at a single human eye from a mathematical perspective (pun not initially intended), the focal length comes out to be around 17.2mm. [as a side note, its aperture is around f/2.1]. Our eye is, indeed, a wide angle lens. Now, the eye's sensor size (the retina) is smaller than the 35mm film sensor that the '50mm normal' is based on. This will make the equivalent focal length of the eye longer, but not by enough to get it to 50mm, there is another factor at play... The images that we take with our 50mm 'normal' lens are generally displayed on a screen, or printed (or developed) and displayed on a wall or in an album. Very rarely do we ever get so close to an image that it takes up our full Field Of View (if we did that, we would not consider the image we saw as 'normal' anymore). We generally hold a photo at a distance that makes it look 'normal' (optimally, at a distance equal its diagonal). Because the image only takes up a portion of our FOV when viewed this way, we are adding an additional crop factor, making the equivalent focal length even longer. Only when we consider all these factors do we come up with a 'normal' focal length value of about 50mm. And remember, that value is only when the image is projected onto a 35mm sensor! for other camera types you need to multiply the magic 50 by your sensor's crop factor to get the 'normal' focal length for your camera.

575352	The (+) and (-) refers to the flow of electrons in the power supply. In a galvanic (Voltaic) cell, the cell itself is the power supply. In an electrolytical cell, the cell is attached to an external power supply. So while the designation of anode and cathode is directly linked to the direction of the flow of electrons in a cell, how (+) and (-) relate to anode and cathode depends on whether the reaction goes towards equilibrium or not (in the case of rechargeable batteries, whether you are draining or charging the battery). Depending on the direction of the reaction, anode and cathode labels change, while (+) and (-) labels stay the same. An example illustrates this. Here are two lead acid batteries connected together in a way where the charged one charges the empty one: The (+) and (-) label relates to the direction electrons would flow if they are discharging (of course, the dead battery can't discharge further, so you could not tell experimentally). The anode and cathode labels refer to the specific situation. So if you attach a higher voltage power supply to the charged battery instead of the dead battery, you would charge it further. This would reverse the chemical reaction in that battery, and the anode and cathode labels would have to be switched. In a different scenario, you could take two 12 volt batteries and connect them in series (connect (+) of one with (-) of the other one). This would give you a 24 volt battery, and if you attach a consumer to it, cathode would be (+) and anode would be (-) for both of them. For the lead acid battery, (+) and (-) never changes, so it is fine to label the electrodes permanently. In a concentration cell, (+) and (-) depends on the concentration of redox species in the two half cells, so you could not label them "with permanent marker".
1270491	There's a bit of confusion here; that /32 doesn't refer to the size of any (sub)network, but to the range of addresses that particular routing table entry applies to. Usually the two are the same (because you route a network or subnet as a unit, right?), but macOS does things a little different for other hosts on the same local network. Let me add some lines before the ones you quoted: Destination Gateway Flags Refs Use Netif Expire default openwrt.lan UGSc 10 0 en0 ... 192.168.1 link#4 UCS 2 0 en0 192.168.1.1/32 link#4 UCS 2 0 en0 openwrt.lan 46:94:fc:63:fc:7 UHLWIir 11 3610 en0 1200 192.168.1.125/32 link#4 UCS 2 0 en0 Note that 192.168.1 (short for 192.168.1.0/24) is routed over en0 (aka link#4); not via any gateway, just over the interface itself. This is the network that the Mac itself is on. 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.125 are both specific addresses within that network range. If you compare those /32 entries with the 192.168.1 entry, they're basically redundant duplicates; they say the same thing, just about specific addresses instead of the entire network range. I don't know why macOS creates these redundant address-specific entries, but it's probably related to another thing you can see in the listing above: macOS lists its ARP table entries in the routing table. The "openwrt.lan" entry above (which I'm pretty sure is actually 192.168.1.1, just listed by name rather than number) says that it's routed via en0 to the MAC address 46:94:fc:63:fc:7. So what you're seeing in the route listing is a mix of actual network routes (like the "default" and 192.168.1 entries), and per-host entries (the /32 and MAC-targeted entries).
2258558	More often than not, they're synonyms. When counting the rhythm of a piece, they are the points at which you may tap your foot, or click you finger. Be aware, though, that people's perception of where a pulse is may vary. Some may clap on 1, 2, 3 and 4. others on 1 and 3, yet others on 2 and 4. It's all pretty straightforward till we come to complex time, such as 6/8, where often two different feels or counts (call them pulses or beats if you like) are present in the same piece. 1 2 3 4 5 6 is one manifestation; 1 - - 2 - - is another. And the difference between 2/4/and 4/4 is sometimes not easy to discern, making the pulse or beat a little muddy. Some refer to a crotchet (quarter note) as a one beat note - I tend to - as it is the basic diet for a lot of rhythms. So in a 4/4 piece - way the most common - it could be said that there are 4 beats to the bar, or the pulse is 1 2 3 4.
485821	Based on your description of a spacesuit with bare legs I believe you are looking for BBC serialisation of The Tripods by John Christopher. I also believe it was broadcast on PBS as I notice one or two references to PBS in my google search for the show. As the show was made by the BBC in the mid 1980s your time frame is correct for this show too. The aliens were depicted as three legged torsos with a single eye. The scene you describe is with the aliens inspecting candidate humans who will be their servants. They do indeed grab at the exposed legs and flesh of the humans. This scene is in episode 5 of season two. You can watch the entire season on youtube but the scene you are describing appears at 9 minutes into the episode.
553791	Simple Answer: The elements are ordered into periods based on which electron shells are being filled (from left to right). In the first period, the first electron shell is being filled. In the second period, the second shell is being filled. And so on. There are 8 elements in period 2 because all those elements have electrons in the second shell and no electrons in the third shell. Elaboration: Electron configuration describes the electrons of an atom in more detail. The elements in the same period all have the same thing at the beginning of their electron configuration. Here are some examples so you can see the pattern: Li - Period 2 - [He] 2s1 Be - Period 2 - [He] 2s2 Ne - Period 2 - [He] 2s2 2p6 Na - Period 3 - [Ne] 3s1 Cl - Period 3 - [Ne] 3s2 3p5 This is the only way I can think of explaining it without going into detail about what the electron configuration means and how it can be used. But as to why there are 8 elements in period 2, all of those 8 elements have an electron configuration that starts like this: [He] 2s Alternate Table: Which one is the right periodic table? There is no right table. These tables are just organizational tools, and you can organize the elements based on a different criteria if you want to. No matter how you organize the table of elements, the elements are still going to have the same properties and react the same way anyway.
560392	In addition to the point made by airhuff, which is that greenhouse gases essentially prevent the earth from emitting infrared radiation into space, this slight effect shifts the equilibria of greenhouse gases which actually amplifies the effect. That is to say, when people speak of $\ce{CO2}$ being a big problem, this mostly because of an indirect effect. $\ce{CO2}$ slightly warms the earth which increases the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere (in an average sort of way because this fluctuates quite a bit). This is a problem because water is a much more potent greenhouse gas than $\ce{CO2}$ and it absorbs at different wavelengths in the IR than $\ce{CO2}$ does. This matters because the amount of IR which $\ce{CO2}$ absorbs is fairly close to saturation. That is, doubling the amount of $\ce{CO2}$ does not mean doubling the amount of IR radiation absorbed and redirected back towards earth. The relationship is much closer to logarithmic than linear. But, this is only true for the wavelengths at which $\ce{CO2}$ absorbs, so introducing more water vapor allows a wavelength of IR to be absorbed which may not be saturated. This is only one mechanism by which greenhouse gases warm the earth. The atmosphere is an extremely complicated system. None of this mentions how well certain gases mix in the atmosphere and how long they stay there and anything about methane for that matter. All of these things have been written about in scholarly articles and books, so those are gonna be the places you find the nitty-gritty details and data. Also a note on what I mean when I say carbon dioxide is roughly saturated in terms of absorbance. It is true that carbon dioxide quite effectively absorbs IR light, but it can never truly be saturated. This is because the relationship is logarithmic, so it always increases, but just more slowly as you add more $\ce{CO2}$. Second, it has been said that convection can play an important role here because one shouldn't really think of bulk concentration of carbon dioxide but really the concentration in different layers of the atmosphere. This complication actually allows $\ce{CO2}$ to absorb more radiation than you might otherwise expect.
677655	Setting aside your initial explanation of the time-series context, it might be useful to look at this as a simple case of observing two data points. For any two observed values $x_1 , x_2$ the sample standard deviation is $s = |x_2 - x_1| / \sqrt2$. This statistic is exactly as informative as giving the sample range of the two values (since it is just a scalar multiple of that statistic). There is nothing inherently wrong with using this statistic as information on the standard deviation of the underlying distribution, but obviously there is a great deal of variability to this statistic. The sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation depends on the underlying distribution for the observable values. In the special case where $X_1, X_2 \sim \text{IID N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ are normal values you have $S \sim \sigma \cdot \chi_1$ which is a scaled half-normal distribution. Obviously this means that your sample standard deviation is quite a poor estimator of the standard deviation parameter (biased and with high variance), but that is to be expected with so little data.
942513	A formula is statement written by the user to be calculated. Formulas can be as simple or as complex as the user wants. A formula can contain values, references to cells, defined names, and functions. All formulas must start with the equals sign. =1+2+3 A function is a piece of code designed to calculate specific values and are used inside formulas. Functions to sum values, calculate a trigonometric cosine, and to calculate the current time are built into excel. Additional functions can be defined using Visual Basic. Functions are typed alongside parenthesizes, where in the arguments if any are listed in between. To use functions in a formula, for example =COS(3.14) will return the calculated cosine. =NOW() returns the current time. =SUM(1+2+3) *2 will multiply the sum by 2 Source
1480196	For most home A/V gear, yes, the black is ground (chassis ground). You can check this with an ohmmeter. Why? Typical A/V gear will use a line-derived high voltage supply with a half-bridge driver, capacitively coupled to the output. Again, why? A line-powered amp has lots of voltage to work with. There is plenty of headroom to avoid voltage clipping, even at high power levels using just a single-ended drive. So it's just not worth the extra expense of using a full-bridge driver - even a switchmode one - for normal consumer A/V gear like a receiver. Car stereos - not so much. Higher power in-dash ones will use a full-bridge drive to maximize the use of the 12V available. Example: single-ended 12V power amp into 4 ohms: Largest AC RMS output: 12V / 2 * 0.707 = 4.24V Power into 4 ohms = 4.24^2 / 4 = 4.5W Bridged 12V power amp into 4 ohms: Largest AC RMS output: 12V / 2 * 0.707 = 4.24V Bridged: 4.24V * 2 = 8.48V Power into 4 ohms = 8.28^2 / 4 = 18W That's a big win for a car stereo, so it's worth the extra expense. Now, car power amps are a different matter. These will use DC-DC step-up make higher rails to achieve higher voltage swings at the output. Some may use bridge, some will not.
109060	On the surface, Owl Eyes is a perceptive character. He sees things that others miss. In reality, though, he's more easily fooled than anyone. The large glasses, of course, tie him to the Eckleburg billboard. There's a continuous contrast between surface and reality in the book, with the nagging question of how to tell the difference. Bigger glasses? Eckleburg's are the biggest, and they don't see what's going on right in front of them. We first meet "Owl Eyes" in Gatsby's library. His real name is never given, but he may represent Ring Lardner. He's looking at volume one of Stoddard's Lectures, one of those books nobody reads but claims they have. He notices it's a book, not a prop, but the pages haven't been cut. (In those days printers saved time by folding up large sheets and binding those together, which left the edges of the book a series of folds rather than pages. To read, then, you needed a paper knife to cut through these folds.) Gatsby has never read the book, and if he hasn't read volume one, he hasn't read any. The book is real, the house is real, but Gatsby is not. Owl Eyes sees that the book is a book, but that's all. He sees the surface but not the reality. "You can't judge a book by its cover" is inverted--he sees inside the book but not inside its owner. We next meet Owl Eyes in the driveway after he's crashed his car. He cheerfully admits he doesn't know how to drive. However, he's managed to block everyone else from leaving, and he has no clue about how to fix the situation. Again, he sees the surface (he knows how to drive) but not the reality (he can't deal with the consequences of a crash). Finally, he shows up at Gatsby's funeral. The only person who feels that much sympathy, besides Nick, is the person who can't see. Gatsby is a cardboard cutout. Owl Eyes has come to his parties and believes the facade is real, but Gatsby died because he wasn't the person he appeared to be. He wasn't a person at all, just a void he hoped Daisy would fill.
419767	In short, the subtractor was Adrian's last-ditch weapon against a being that has almost godlike powers. He's smart enough to have built an open sided Intrinsic Field Subtractor and there's at least a (very) slim chance that it might work and that the fields research that gave John his powers might also have the power to destroy him. When it doesn't work, Adrian isn't especially surprised, nor does he have a backup plan. John does at least give him an 'A' for effort, while pointing out that his "ultimate weapon" is actually a bit crap. In Before Watchmen: Dr. Manhattan #4, we see that Dr Manhattan had an earlier conversation with Veidt about his abilities. Note he states that he tries to avoid taking himself apart as that would... "...constitute the destruction of the body"
558622	A mixture is when two or more substances combine physically together. However, in water, two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom chemically, forming a new substance that has properties different from hydrogen alone or oxygen alone. For example, if you combine iron powder and sulfur powder physically (just mixing them together without applying heat), you can find that the mixture retains the properties of the original components, i.e. you can still use a magnet to attract the iron inside the mixture. However, if you heat it up, the iron and the sulfur would combine chemically, and a new compound would be formed, which we call "iron sulfur" ($\ce{FeS}$). This is a new compound and loses the properties of the original compounds. For example, it is not attracted by magnets. Therefore, water is not a mixture; it is a compound and it is pure.
651844	Compilation and expansion of comments: Let's presume your data is Normally distributed. If you want to form two-sided error bars (or confidence intervals), say at the 95% level, you will need to base that on the Student t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of data points. You propose to have 2 data points, therefore requiring use of Student t with 1 degree of freedom. 95% 2-sided error bars for n = 2 data points require a multiplicative factor of 12.71 on the sample standard deviation, not the familiar factor of 1.96 based on the Normal (Student t with $\infty$ degrees of freedom). The corresponding multiplicative factor for n = 3 data points is 4.30. The situation gets even more extreme for two-sided 99% error bars (confidence intervals). As you can see, at either confidence level, there's a big "savings" in the multiplicative factor if you have 3 data points instead of 2. And you don't get dinged as badly by the use of n-1 vs. n in the denominator of sample standard deviation. n Confidence Level Multiplicative Factor 2 0.95 12.71 3 0.95 4.30 4 0.95 3.18 5 0.95 2.78 infinity 0.95 1.96 2 0.99 63.66 3 0.99 9.92 4 0.99 5.84 5 0.99 4.60 infinity 0.99 2.58
1249780	About the filesystem mounted on /mnt/c What exactly is /mnt/c/Users/ compared with C:\Users<username>? It seems they are one in the same---so what is /mnt/c/? In contrast to Windows, Linux (and the other systems based on Unix) use a single folder structure independent of the number of disks you have. If you have multiple disks, all these disks must me mounted into the folder structure at some point. Typically, all the disks (different than the used to boot the system) are mounted in a folder named /mnt or /media WSL has an special type of filesystem named DrvFS that gives you access to the disks used in windows. You can use DrvFS to mount, not only your windows filesystem, but also network disks and other media types. In WSL, by default, the C: disk in windows is mounted under /mnt/c If you have another disk, for instance a D: disk in windows, it will be mounted under /mnt/d The files you can see in /mnt/c are the same you have in C:. If you modify some file, you will get the changes in the windows too. You may use the mount command to access other types of media (e.g. removable drives or network shares). About the location of /home/<username> How can I view the files in /home/ using the Windows File Explorer? Not that I'd really ever want to---I'm just trying to get a feel for how Windows is organizing this Subsystem for Linux thing. In WSL, all the linux filesystem is located under a Windows folder. The location of the folder depends on the version of Windows and of the WSL distribution you are using. Initial versions of WSL store the linux filesystem in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Lxss\rootfs WSL distributions installed from the Windows Store, starting in Windows Build 16215 (mid of 2017), use a folder like %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\{package}\LocalState\rootfs. The name of the package varies depending on the distribution (e.g. it is different for Ubuntu than for Debian). For Ubuntu on Windows it is CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_{code}, for example. Linux distributions installed using other tools, such as lxRunOffline or WSL-DistroLauncher may store the linux filesystem into any location. You may check many options to know the location of the WSL folder. For instance, I think the easiest option is to use lxRunOffline to know the installation folder. ## You can use lxrunoffline to check which WSL distributions have installed ## using: lxrunoffline list C:\> lxrunoffline list backup Ubuntu-18.04 ## And you can use it to get the location of any of these WSL installations ## using: lxrunoffline get-dir -n <name of distribution> C:\> lxrunoffline get-dir -n backup c:\wsl\installed\backup C:\> lxrunoffline get-dir -n Ubuntu C:\Users\Jaime\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState Once you know the location of the installation folder, the /home/<username> is under <installation folder>\rootfs\home\username. For instance, if your installation folder is c:\wsl\ubuntu the /home/<username> is in c:\wsl\ubuntu\rootfs\home\username NOTE: Both Linux and Windows stores file permissions in different ways. Nowadays, the WSL DrvFS stores the Linux permissions as Streams (metadata) attached to the files you can see in Windows. Microsoft does not recommend to modify linux files using Windows programs. It is possible that some Windows applcations damage the linux permissions without notice it.
2247928	On the face of it, it doesn't make sense. But intervals are taken from the major scale notes. Thus a major 3rd is, say, from C to E. When an interval is made smaller by a semitone, it's called a minor. Thus a minor 3rd is C to Eb. Yes, it happens to be in the minor scale/key as well. This applies to most intervals, but not perfect ones - fifths, for instance. Major 7ths would be C to B, whereas C to Bb is a minor 7th. The major second, in your question, is C to D, so when that is changed into C to Db, it's called a minor 2nd. Note that C to C# is NOT the same, even if, on most instruments, it sounds it. The way it gets written down is important. It doesn't mean that the Db is in the minor scale. The 6th is another confusing one. C to A is major 6th, and C to Ab is minor 6th. However, a minor 6th CHORD doesn't have a minor 6th interval. It's spelled C Eb G A - with a minor triad, but a major 6th interval. Going back to perfects - there are no minor 5ths. If C to G is a perfect 5th, then C to Gb is called a diminished 5th.Perfect 4ths are treated the same. So, in summary - 2nds,3rds, 6ths and 7ths can all be major or minor, and if they are made even smaller, by another semitone, they are called diminished. Perfect 4ths and 5ths change to diminished when they are one semitone smaller.
493574	It's actually just happenstance. The 35mm film still format was developed from an existing 35mm cine format, shot "sideways" to increase the image size, and the 2-inch cine lens was a cheap off-the-shelf lens at the time. Both decisions were cost-saving measures; 35mm film allowed the use of film ends, the unexposed bits at the end of, say, a 400-foot roll of film, and the 2-inch lens (a common, simple, easy-to-produce design) had the needed image circle while still being cheap enough. All of these decisions were made before a 35mm rangefinder camera was made, let alone a SLR. 50mm is actually rather long for a "normal lens". Consider that a 35mm frame is 24mm by 36mm. A square medium format camera has a frame that is 56mm by 56mm, and the "normal" lens for that format is 80mm; 150mm is considered "normal" for a 4x5 (inch) camera (think Speed Graphic).
808564	I'm wondering where you got your list. It appears that other days might be better choices. As an example, for Porto-Vecchio, April 20,2019 is a day late: Apr 19, 2018 sunset: 20:07, moonrise: 20:13, diff: 0:06 The moon rises about 50 minutes later on consecutive days. In addition, the sunset time might be changing by a couple of minutes a day as well. Since sunset only happens once a day, then we'd expect the rise after a full moon to be anywhere in that ~50 minute period late. On average then, I'd expect the closest sunset/moonrise of a month to usually be a quarter of that range (cut in half because closest could be before or after, and another half for variation) or about 15 minutes. There are a lot of sites with accurate sunset/moonrise times, but I don't know of any that directly give the delta between them. Could probably create one with some python scripts, but not something I've done.
997293	Tricky! A DNS Server typically is for converting FQDN (www.xxx.com) to IP Addresses (192.168.0.1). (A DNS Server also does a lot more, it can perform reverse lookups, and in recent years does a lot of other tasks with text tags, geo-ip and a lot more). On the other hand, "Name Server" is typically used to locate a DNS Server. For example, On a Whois record, a Name Server is typically the address for the DNS server that hosts the records for that domain. A further more complicated example is, if you queried www.superuser.com, you would go to your dns server and a recursive DNS lookup would occur on the superuser's nameserver. As for how many are there - how long is a piece of string! This is an impossible question to answer... As a guess, I would put it in to the hundreds of thousands, if not low millions (for publicly accessible DNS Servers).
1018185	Yes, both GnuPG and the commercial PGP.com are implementations of the same OpenPGP standard; in fact, GnuPG was specifically designed to be PGP-compatible. The only differences you might encounter are: Different supported algorithms. For example, GnuPG supports the Camellia encryption algorithm, while PGP.com does not. This is almost never a problem, though, as every PGP certificate ("PGP key") lists all algorithms that the owner's software supports (or more precisely those which the owner prefers to be used), so a message's sender can always pick a supported one. Various quirks and differences in really old versions of PGP (especially the original releases from before OpenPGP was standartized). However, both GnuPG and PGP.com can easily read (if not always write) messages in the old formats. tl;dr: Yes, they are compatible.
1683181	First, you may want to use the shell terminal in order to try to access your folders, so you can confirm if they exist or not, and, if they exist, see if they're empty or not. To do so, open a shell terminal window and run this supercommand: cd ~ && ls -las --color |more You'll see a colorful list of all the contents of your home folder (/home/cosmin). Even hidden files and folders will be shown to you. Press the spacebar key to scroll 1 page down and see more of the contents of your home directory. Repeat the process until the end. This will allow you to check if your personal directories - like Downloads, Documents et cetera - are still there. If they are, you can cd into them and check their contents. For instance, if the Downloads folder is present inside of your home folder, then this supercommand: cd ~/Downloads && ls -las --color |more ...will show you what's inside of that folder. If your folders are not present, then they were deleted. I'm sorry, they're gone, you'll have to recreate them. Please read this post about how to create new user accounts, manually create user folders et cetera. If your folders are present, then close your file manager and run this command in the shell terminal: xdg-user-dirs-update Now try to access your folder again. If it didn't work, run this other command: xdg-user-dirs-update --set DOCUMENTS $HOME/Documents If it works, just repeat the process with your other directories: xdg-user-dirs-update --set DOWNLOAD $HOME/Downloads xdg-user-dirs-update --set MUSIC $HOME/Music xdg-user-dirs-update --set PICTURES $HOME/Pictures xdg-user-dirs-update --set VIDEOS $HOME/Videos ...and so on. For more info, run this shell command: info xdg-user-dirs-update If xdg-user-dirs-update doesn't solve the problem, you may want to try something more extreme, like the following supercommand: sudo rm -rfv ~/.cache ~/.config ~/.local ~/.profile && sudo telinit 6 The supercommand above will delete your profile's cache, GUI configuration files, profile data and preferences, then restart the system. Afterwards, you may try running those xdg-user-dirs-update --set... commands again. If nothing works but your personal folders (Downloads, Documents etc.) exist and are not empty, make a backup of them. E.g. if you plug in a flash drive mounted at /media/cosmin/BACKUP, then you can run this command: sudo cp -R ~ /media/cosmin/BACKUP ...or you may prefer to copy folders one by one: sudo cp -R ~/Downloads /media/cosmin/BACKUP sudo cp -R ~/Documents /media/cosmin/BACKUP sudo cp -R ~/Pictures /media/cosmin/BACKUP ...and so on. After the backup, use the control panel in order to: Create a new user account and give it administrative privileges (this is gonna be your new account). Then delete the (now old) account "cosmin". Copy the contents from your backup back to your personal folders. Note: do NOT overwrite the folders! E.g. if the new account is cosmin2, then instead of copying /media/cosmin/BACKUP/Downloads over /home/cosmin2/Downloads, you'll have to access /media/cosmin/BACKUP/Downloads and copy everything that's inside this folder, then paste them inside of /home/cosmin2/Downloads.
2018126	Is there some kind of "subdomain listing" query for DNS? There is no query for this specific purpose, but there are a few indirect methods. A non-incremental zone transfer (AXFR). Most server operators lock down zone transfers to specific IP addresses to prevent unaffiliated parties from snooping around. If DNSSEC is enabled, iterative NSEC requests can be used to walk the zone. NSEC3 was implemented to make zone walking more computationally intensive. There's also a trick that will let someone know if an arbitrary subdomain exists. example.com. IN A 198.51.100.1 www.sub.example.com. IN A 198.51.100.2 In the above example, www lies within sub. A query for sub.example.com IN A will not return an ANSWER section, but the result code will be NOERROR instead of NXDOMAIN, betraying the existence of records further down the tree. (just not what those records are named) Should secrecy of DNS records ever be relied upon? No. The only way to reliably hide data from a client is to ensure that it can never get the data to begin with. Assume that existence of your DNS records will be spread among whoever has access to them, either by word of mouth or by observing the packets. If you're trying to hide records from a routable DNS client, You're Doing It Wrong™. Make sure the data is only exposed to the environments that need it. (i.e. use privately routed domains for private IPs) Even if you have such a division set up, assume that knowledge of the IP addresses will be spread around anyway. The focus on security should be on what happens when someone gets the IP address, because it's going to happen. I'm aware that the list of reasons for IP address secrecy being a pipe dream could be expanded on further. IP scanning, social engineering...the list is endless, and I'm mostly focusing on the DNS protocol aspects of this question. At the end of the day, it all falls under the same umbrella: someone is going to get your IP address.
2380369	It's not just the number of lumens you have (*) -- its the distribution. You need to aim your light at the ground at an appropriate angle, not into the eyes of motorists. If you have something like a flood light like the coast guard uses, thats no good to aim -- bicycle-specific lights will be easier to aim in a proper manner. If your light is aimed properly, pedestrians shouldn't really have a problem as well and you shouldn't be blinding cars. Look at the beamshots on @nhinkle's bikelightdb for seeing what appropriate aim looks like. (*) You didn't mention the model of light. Just because it says x lumens doesn't mean you're getting x lumens. Also, in regards to distribution, there were some cheap Chinese lights (~10-20 USD) which had very high light output and were very cheap a few years ago (used big batteries and stuff). These were somewhat problematic as you couldn't aim the beam. An aside: As a driver, I find these new blue-white LED lights on Audis and similar a bit distracting. So the color can be a bit distracting, but no bike light is nearly that intense anyway so the point is somewhat moot.
2408399	Manual transmission BOXES last much longer than automatics. The clutches, however, vary with the driver. If the driver is good, then the manual is just as good as the automatic. If not, then the automatic's clutches will last longer. This is true because there is at least one clutch for each gear in an automatic, and you can't replace them without rebuilding the entire transmission. You also can't normally operate the transmission if even one of them is unserviceable...they will cause the others to fail. Cost of rebuilding is $1000-$2500. The manual has one large clutch. Replacing it requires temporarily removing the entire transmission. But good manual transmission drivers commonly have clutches that run over 100,000 miles (or even many hundreds of thousands). Cost of replacing a clutch is $450-$600. The clutch itself only costs $100-$150. The rest is labor. The way to make an auto transmission last longer is to keep the fluid cooler. For most systems this involves a separate transmission cooler unit, possibly a cooling fan, and one of various types of transmission temperature sensor and gauge. Yes. It is more expensive to maintain an automatic because it will eventually require fluid and filter changes which may not be within the capability of a Do-It-Yourself-er. The automatic will also be less fuel efficient in otherwise identical vehicles, by the very nature of the automatic's fluid coupling with the engine through the torque converter versus the manual transmission's physical coupling through the clutch. You should note that Automatic transmission fluid change may not be required for the first 100K miles in some models. Materials in models that can be changed by a DIY-er usually cost $30-60 for fluid and about $20 for filter and gasket. For a shop to do it usually costs from $100-$300 (or even more) depending on the transmission. But it is rare for an automatic to go much beyond 150K miles or so without a rebuild...because of the accumulated effects of heat on clutch material, soft parts, and normal wear on springs that most manuals don't have. The way to extend that time is by controlling transmission temperature. So your friend is right, if we are talking about a driver who does not drive in a way that burns out clutches, and if he is going to keep the vehicle for a long time. Otherwise...it depends on how many clutches he burns out. Or you might be right, if we are talking about stop-and-go traffic in an auto with a great transmission cooling system, or if you only intend to keep the vehicle for 30K or so miles as most people do.
212506	I think the easiest way to do make physical contact impossible is for one (or both) species to evolve beyond the corporeal state. Your species might even be subspecies rather than independent species. Moreover, the story can be scientifically plausible. For example, several centuries ago your humanoids finally managed to upload their minds to a global network. Half of the population decided to abandon their bodies and continue existence in a digitised form. The other half, 'naturalists', opposed them claiming that this decision goes against everything humanoids stand for... The Great Schism led to a long war with countless victims. But eventually, there were no more 'digitisers' left that could be killed. 'Naturalists' went back to 'natural and sustainable' lifestyles, while 'digitisers' enjoy their perfect virtual reality. However, they still hate each other, even though even virtually immortal 'digitisers' are starting to forget what was all the fuss about...
402988	Karlon Stark's split was a thousand years ago. So that's a thousand years separation of bloodline. For some reason we have seen no cadet Stark houses, and their absence is something of a mystery. But even if Ned Stark's family is indeed the last pure blooded Starks, there are still many families that have married into the Starks and may lay claim should the Stark line become extinguished. The Westerlings may claim it through marriage to King Robb Stark, although the circumstances surrounding the whole deal might put a spanner in the works since you'll probably need the support of the North to hold Winterfell. The Tullys through marriage with Ned Stark is another claimant, and while we don't know who Ned's mother was her house would be another claimant.

1043024	No. (Unless your definition of equality does not extend past »It is a text interface and I can run programs from it.«) What is run when you click Command Prompt in the Start Menu is the Windows Command Processor, a.k.a. cmd.exe. Its built-in commands and scripting syntax (including many quirks) are based on the ancient command.com from CP/M and later MS-DOS, but apart from that they are completely separate things. Also, command.com is a 16-bit program while cmd.exe is a native Windows console application. Things were different in Windows 95, 98 and ME where command.com would be run in a MS-DOS VM with Windows acting as the hypervisor (yes, they had that sort of thing at the time already). There you had an entire virtual machine running DOS. But on Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista and 7 – no. DOS only lives on there in ntvdm.exe which is the NT Virtual DOS Machine which is just a thin emulation layer capturing calls that the CPU cannot execute directly (which is why it works faster but worse than DOSBox). In any case, even command.com was just a shell for DOS. It wasn't the operating system. Inside, I actually cringe each time I see people referring to a window with gray-on-black text as MS-DOS. In the vast majority of cases they don't actually know what they're referring to.
1231122	Outbound means you initiate the connection and the traffic starts flowing outward of your computer to the destination you intended. Example you connect to a server. Inbound means someone else from outside of your computer initiate the connection to your computer, so the traffic starts flowing inward to your machine. Example your server gets requests from people. This doesn't mean the actual dataflow. Inbound doesn't mean always inward traffic, and outward doesn't mean always outward traffic, because ports like TCP needs both directions in order to establish the connection, and therefore Windows firewall doesn't block one direction, but the direction of the person or the device that starts the dataflow. So if you only block outbound traffic of Chrome, it means Chrome can't initiate traffic to outside, but Google can initiate traffic to Chrome.
2358452	This is two three-way switches from the looks of things, but wired in a nonstandard fashion From the wires you have, this does appear to be a fairly basic three-way switch circuit with both switches on loops from the light fixture, but with the way the second switch is wired, and the way you were able to get it working, it's not a standard three-way switch. Instead, it's what's called a "California" or "Coast" 3-way setup that brings always-hot to a traveler terminal on both switches and switched-hot to the other traveler terminal on the switches, then connects their commons together. This yields a working 3-way switch arrangement, as depicted below (illustration courtesy of Wtshymanski/Wikipedia), and has the advantage of providing always-hot and switched-hot at both switch locations, but has the downside that you can't add another switch to it.
500870	It's important to realize that "bridge camera" is not a technical term. It's a marketing term *, made up to sell more-expensive cameras to intermediate photographers who are beyond point and shoots but are intimidated by the cost or complexity of a SLR. Generally, the things sold as bridge cameras are bulky point and shoots which kind of look like they might be an SLR. Usually, they have superzoom lenses built-in. Somewhat ironically (or maybe just unfortunately), this isn't what someone needs if they really wants a "bridge" to go from naïve to knowledgeable photography. There's a little more on this in the answers to this question Is there any bridge camera with an interchangeable lens? (To which the answer is: by definition, no.) I think this term really should be obsolete in this decade, as the market has many great actual intermediate cameras that are definitely not point-and-shoot in the sense of no control or advanced functionality. The new Canon G1 X, which has a large (basically micro-4/3rds sized) sensor but a non-interchangeable zoom lens is a poster-child for this, but also pretty much all the lower-range mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras too. Basically, there's a whole bunch of advanced cameras which are not DSLRs but also beyond point and shoot. One could apply the term "bridge" to all of these, but I don't think it's very useful. I recommend ignoring this term and talking about specific cameras (or groups of cameras — all the small-sensor superzooms are basically identical) or specific features (like a large sensor in a compact camera body). * See newspaper article from 1998 about the "new" type of camera.
956540	Even though the BIOS isn't detecting a system fan doesn't mean there isn't one. Not all fans, especially on older systems, are designed to actually transmit data to and from the BIOS, so it's possible you have a model that just turns on when there's power supplied to it, and shuts down when there's not. The only real downside to having a dumb fan rather than a smart fan, other than the disconcerting "0 RPM" message, is efficiency. A dumb fan will be on all the time, whether or not your system actually needs it. With smart fans, the BIOS can turn it on full during heavy use, shut it down when the system's idle, and warn you when it's not working properly. Even if it's missing entirely, it's not 100% necessary unless your system has a tendency to overheat without one. Older computers in general don't generate near as much heat as modern systems, so their cooling requirements are far less imposing than anything you'd find today.
1147141	Black and white (monochrome),has only two "colors", black (ink or toner) and white (no ink or toner). It is used for things like text, where you want everything that is a printed character to be black and the background white (unprinted). Grayscale contains shades of grey and is used for reproducing images. In photographic and similar processes, it is a continuous scale from black to white. On consumer laser and inkjet printers, the printer creates the shades using patterns of micro-dots that generally require magnification to see. These patterns are typically designed to reproduce approximately 256 discrete shades. On a multi-function printer, say you want to photocopy some text. When you scan the page, the paper and wrinkles will have some color (not pure white), and areas of the text might be faint. If you print that in grayscale, you will get an accurate "photograph" of what the scanner saw. If you want maximum readability, you would use black and white, which would force everything darker than a certain threshold to black and everything else would be white. This will be easier to read and a better representation of how the original came out of the printer.
1693487	One could solve the issue in the following way: cat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null No. The chances file will be truncated drop, but there's no guarantee cat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null will not truncate file. It all depends on which command is processed first, as as opposed to what one may expect, commands in a pipe are not processed left-to-right. There's no guarantee about which command will be picked first, so one might as well just think of it as randomly picked and never rely on the shell not picking the offending one. Since the chances for the offending command to be picked first in between three commands are lower than the chances for the offending command to be picked first in between two commands, it's less likely that file will be truncated, but it's still going to happen. script.sh: #!/bin/bash for ((i=0; i<100; i++)); do cat >file <<-EOF foo bar EOF cat file | sed 's/bar/baz/' | tee file >/dev/null [ -s file ] && echo 'Not truncated' || echo 'Truncated' done | sort | uniq -c rm file % bash script.sh 93 Not truncated 7 Truncated % bash script.sh 98 Not truncated 2 Truncated % bash script.sh 100 Not truncated So never use something like cat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null. Use sponge as Oli suggested. As an alternative, for thighter environments and / or relatively small files one may use a here string and a command substitution to read the file before any command is run: $ cat file foo bar $ for ((i=0; i<100; i++)); do <<<"$(<file)" sed 's/bar/baz/' >file; done $ cat file foo baz
2104867	No DNS records are required to send email, however, not having appropriate mail-related DNS records for your domain is likely to result in getting discarded by spam filters. Your shop.mydomain.com server should be probably be treated as a host authorized to send mail rather than as a child domain. I know of at least one service that will up the spam probability score if an MX record is not present for the domain. Having other DNS entries, like valid PTR records for mail servers and records for Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) for the domain will also help. There is a good article by rackAID, 3 DNS Records Every Email Marketer Must Know, that outlines the basics of DNS interaction with spam filtering.
2223587	I'd try and be more specific towards the kind of the fuel we are talking about: White Gas / Naphtha Burns clean without any smell and/or effect on food taste. Accidental Spilling of the fuel is not much to be worried about. Evaporates very quickly, without leaving an odor. That said, make a note that the spilled fuel is very flammable White gas is safer to store and transport than probably most of the other products. Additional information: White gas is a more volatile distillate of petroleum, to which no poisonous automotive-oriented chemicals have been added. It is much safer to store and use, with far superior shelf-life than gasoline/petrol (https://www.britannica.com/science/naphtha). Propane/Butane/Isobutane Gas A Propane gas stove would most likely be a Canister type? So, pressurized fuel? : Might be more dangerous if canister is leaking? Most of the products that are available are the ones that work on Propane and Primarily Isobutane. They burn hot and clean. Pressurized fuel = No Pumping, preheating required. No spill play at all as the canister holds the pressurized gas, so self-seals when the stove is detached: Safe! As you don't pour the fuel into the canister yourself, its difficult to gauge remaining fuel level. Performance degrades when the fuel is consumed beyond a certain level because the pressure is not enough to inject the fuel into the jets. Take an example of a aerosol deodorant. So, when nearly emptied, the remaining fuel is apparently useless. Fuel is more expensive. If its Butane, it doesn't work in freezing conditions. If its Propane, it will work under conditions roughly upto -32 C. I know someone who has used it at that temperature. Kerosene Stove function really well in extremely cold temperatures. Burns hot, better than Alcohol stoves. Relatively inexpensive fuel. Needs proper storing, since it evaporates slowly if spilled. Prone to spills during the pouring process. But, spilled fuel won't ignite easily. Not Odorless. Many of the Kerosene based stoves need pumping and pre-heating. Some points about common terms used in different parts of the world. Thanks to A E for suggesting this concept and the data provided. I have done a mere copy+paste from comments. It would be helpful if this question/answer also contains the translation for non-American readers. In the UK, 'Coleman fuel' is same as what is known as 'White Gas' in America. 'Propane' and 'Butane' are two universal terms for two different chemical compounds. (Some people find it hard to understand what this means, So, it means, Propane is not equal to Butane, those are two different chemical comppounds. The compound which people around you call as 'Propane', probably almost everywhere in the world its called 'Propane', same goes for a different compound called Butane.) US 'Kerosene' is UK 'paraffin', the same in India is 'Kerosene' and more popularly known as 'Rockel'. US 'Gasoline' is UK 'Petrol'. In the UK, they also have 'White spirit' which should not be confused with 'White gas', it's not the same thing. 'White Gas/Coleman Fuel' is called 'Naphtha' in Eastern Canada, and English-speaking chemistry labs.
2258568	A pulse is the heartbeat of the rhythm/music that you hear - and feel - when listening to music and this is what people usually tap along to when listening. The beat is the repeated note value of the time signature. They can often (and are usually) the same thing, or at least they cross over. However I shall give some examples: In a piece with time sig 4/4, the beat is 4 crotchet beats every bar. The pulse is most likely also going to be this however if some notes are more pronounced you may tap your foot 2 beats/bar. In a piece with time sig 6/8, the beat is 6 quaver beats/bar whereas the pulse is usually 2 beats/notes at intervals of dotted crotchets. It will be felt as: 1-and-a-2-and-a, 1-and-a-2-and-a, etc. where '1' is where you tap your foot, the pulse.
911574	YES. A micro-atx motherboard will work fine with an ATX case and power supply. Atx cases normaly included the standoff mounts for smaller mirco-atx motherboards. In fact, I have a micro-ATX motherboard in a full size ATX case and power supply. MicroATX was intended to be backward compatible. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroATX microATX was explicitly designed to be backward-compatible with ATX. The mounting points of microATX motherboards are a subset of those used on full-size ATX boards, and the I/O panel is identical. Thus, microATX motherboards can be used in full-size ATX cases. Furthermore, most microATX motherboards generally use the same power connectors as ATX motherboards,[6] thus permitting the use of full-size ATX power supplies with microATX boards. microATX boards often use the same chipsets (northbridges and southbridges) as full-size ATX boards, allowing them to use many of the same components. However, since microATX cases are typically much smaller than ATX cases, they usually have fewer expansion slots.
1006946	Cluster Slack Space You cannot access each individual byte on a storage medium separately. To do so would be terribly inefficient because the system needs some way of keeping track of which ones are used and which are free (i.e., a list), so doing so for each byte separately would create too much overheard (for each individual byte, i.e. 1-to-1, the list would be as big as the medium itself!) Instead, the medium is broken up into chunks, blocks, units, groups, whatever you want to call them (the technical term is clusters), each of which contains a—consistent—number of bytes (you can usually specify the size of the clusters since different uses call for different sizes to reduce waste). When a file is saved to disk, the size of the file is divided by the cluster size and rounded up if needed. This means that unless the filesize is exactly divisible by the cluster size, some of the cluster ends up being unused and thus wasted. When you view the properties for a file, you see the true size of the file as well as the size it takes up on disk which includes any “slack”, that is, the “cluster tips” that are unused. This is usually not much per-file and the size on disk will usually be almost equal to the actual size, but when you add up the wasted space from all the thousands of files on a drive, they can add up. Therefore, when you view the size of a large folder, especially one with many tiny files that are smaller than a cluster, the size on disk (i.e., the amount of disk space marked as used) can end up being significantly larger than the actual size (i.e., the amount space the files actual require). In a case like above, what you can try is to reduce the cluster size so that each file wastes less space. Generally, a drive with mostly lost of little files should use the smallest cluster size possible (to reduce waste) and a drive with mostly large files should use the largest cluster size possible (this way the bookkeeping structures end up being smaller). Even at a lower level, if each cluster is only a single sector, unless a file is an exact multiple of the size of the sectors on the drive (usually 512 bytes traditionally, now often 4,096 with Advanced Format disks), then there will still be unused space between the end of the file and the end of the sector. Compression Another scenario where you might see a difference between the actual file size and size on disk is with compression. When a drive is compressed (e.g., using DriveSpace, NTFS compression, etc.) then there will be a difference between the size of the actual file (which needs to be know), and the actual size that the file occupies (i.e., uses or “takes up”) on the disk. Shortcuts and Hardlinks Yet another scenario that could result in a difference is with hardlinks. With file-systems that support hardlinks, when a duplicate file is created, instead of making a whole new file that takes up space for itself, the file-system creates a shortcut to the file so that both (or all three, etc.) copies point to the same physical file on disk. Therefore, when there are two files pointing to the same data, they each have the same size, but take up only slightly more than the space to store a single copy.
1165140	I think this is much more complex than a single answer. There are many different types of Bluetooth connections, not all of these connections are interchangeable. It also depends heavily upon which version of Bluetooth is being used in the devices, both the reciever for the PC and the controller. As you can see from the Bluetooth 4.2 specification, which is 2,772 pages, it is quite complex. Bluetooth 4.2 specification document: https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=286439 I doubt a definitive answer can be given to this question as to all Bluetooth devices in all scenarios. I would however in this case as it's quite a simple scenario, purchase a single Bluetooth adapter and try to connect four controllers. I suspect that it will work from what I have deduced from the Bluetooth specification but I would ensure that you purchase a 4.2 Bluetooth adapter. Apple Website FAQ The official Bluetooth specifications state seven is the maximum number of Bluetooth devices that can be connected at once. However, three to four devices is a practical limit, depending on the types of devices and profiles are used. Some devices require more Bluetooth data, so they are more demanding than other devices. Data-intensive devices may reduce the total number of devices that can be active at the same time. If a Bluetooth device becomes slow to connect or does not perform reliably, reduce the total number of connected devices. Apple Website Bluetooth FAQ As can be seen from the official Apple website they state that the maximum number of connected devices is 7. The official Bluetooth spec says that up to 255 sleeping devices can be connected. This would indicate that the maximum number of parallel active connections is 7, however due to the complexity of the connections and amount of data to be transferred in most scenarios the practical limit is 3 or 4. Bluetooth signal can also be effected largely by other household devices such as Wifi, Microwaves and Household Phones. A true answer to this would be difficult to come by in relation to your exact scenario due to the large number of variables, however we can see that theoretically seven devices can have active connections in parallel and as reported by Apple the practical limit in the majority of scenarios is 3 or 4.
1571996	In theory, an Android phone doesn't need a computer to upgrade. In practice, this is usually the case - all I had to do to upgrade was home, menu, settings, about phone, software version, check for updates, apply. (It was something like that, but it's also sometimes a little different by phone as well.) It should be noted that occasionally, a company will force you to use their proprietary desktop software to upgrade your phone. They will almost certainly distribute their software for only Windows, and so unless it works in WINE or Mono it won't work in Linux. What kind of Android phone do you have? Also, if you plan on rooting and using a custom ROM, all you need for this is to put the ROM on the micro-SD card in the phone, which can be done on whatever OS you like. Again, it's an entirely phone-contained process after you root. Rooting works on Windows, Mac, and Linux; you need to have the android SDK setup and Mono set up and use SuperOneClick.
2411982	There is a recall on my car, but I'm so far ignoring it. There is a recall on your car. Do not ignore it. This is not a task an amateur can tackle, but an amateur can bring their vehicle to their dealer to have the defective parts professionally replaced and the problem solved without compromising vehicle safety or legality. Is disabling, or even removing, the two inflators a task that an amateur can tackle? Note that given the relatively low incidence of defective parts (see also the airbag-related injury note in the article you linked to, noting also the seriousness of the "Who should consider..." section), combined with other chances, you are replacing an extremely low, albeit highly sensationalized, safety risk (potentially defective airbag) with an extremely high safety risk (no airbag), a high risk of performing the procedure incorrectly, and an extremely high financial risk of voiding your insurance in certain jurisdictions (which also places other vehicles involved in the collision in high financial risk, as well as presents possible difficulties for injured persons seeking medical care). This is not a sensible trade. That is not to say that the defects should be ignored or are not important. However, the solution is to honor the recall to correct the problem while maintaining safety, not to disable safety. However, the choice is yours as are the potential consequences. If you insist on proceeding with what appears to be an objectively misguided plan, I would first consult the service manual for your specific make and model of vehicle, which will give you the technical details you need, as it will differ per vehicle. You may at least want to inform your passengers that you have disabled their airbags to allow them to make their own informed choice about whether or not to get in the car with you.
2422778	The fitment front and rear are going to be extremely different. Not only is the diameter and braking surface completely different sizes, the rear disks have a separate machined area inside the hat (the part where it attaches to the hub) which is used for the parking brake. The front one has no such provision. For your husband's 2000 Chevy Silverado, the following are different rear brake rotors by part numbers: Economy: Durago - PN: BR55066 Bendix - PN: PRT5265 Centric - PN: 12166041 Power Stop - PN: AR8641 ACDelco - PN: 18A952A Daily Driver: Bosch - PN: 25010532 Centric - PN: 12066041 Raybestos - PN: 56827 ACDelco - PN: 18A952 Heavy Duty: Bendix - PN: SDR5265 ACDelco - PN: 18A952SD You should be able to look these up on Amazon, RockAuto.com, or just Google the part numbers. I had thought the Silverado/Sierras came with either drum or disks, but I'm not seeing a drum listed for the 2000 model year. My 2006 and my son's 2005 Silverados both have drum rears. Before you order anything for your husband's truck, ensure it has disks.
43156	UPDATE February 01, 2018, the OED has recently added the word swag in its dictionary. Oxford Online Dictionaries reports A new entry has been added for swag, derived from swagger, and used in slang to denote ‘bold self-assurance in style or manner’, or ‘an air of great self-confidence or superiority’. The OED’s first citation for this particular sense comes from the track ‘December 4th’ on Jay-Z’s The Black Album (2003): ‘My self-esteem went through the roof, man. I got my swag.’ This is the fifth OED citation attributed to Jay-Z. A glossarial example of the word from the previous year, in a self-described dictionary of hip-hop terminology, defined swag as simply ‘walk’. ORIGINAL POST (October 12, 2016) “Obama displayed similar swag and bluster …” In his sixth State of the Union Address, President Obama said: We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve (Applause). From whitehouse.gov, January 20, 2015 The swag appears to be a clipped form of swagger, which the article accuses President Obama of doing. In the speech, the ‘swag’ refers to America standing strong, unafraid of Russia, and determined to enforce sanctions. The bluster, according to the author, is Obama's words whose tone was possibly concealing a threat to Putin. The fact that Obama asserted America did not engage in bluster, was telling the audience that America was not afraid of taking further action if necessary. bluster talk intended to seem important or threatening but which is not taken seriously and has little effect swagger to walk, esp. with a swinging movement, in a way that shows that you are confident and think you are important Cambridge Dictionary

303274	From page 194 of the Player's Handbook: If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter. From page 196 of the Player's Handbook: When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add then together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. This applies to all attacks, whether they are melee weapon attacks, ranged weapon attacks, melee spell attacks, ranged spell attacks, etc. If you are rolling a d20 versus AC, then you score a critical hit on a 20, and unless you have a class feature, feat, etc. that says otherwise, you roll damage dice twice when you get a critical hit.
332227	Spells fizzle in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 2nd Edition As other answers mention, the word fizzle can be traced back quite a ways, but as a Dungeons & Dragons game term it's the Player's Handbook (1989) for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition that I think first uses the word fizzle in an official capacity. On Wisdom on Chance of Spell Failure says Priests with low Wisdom scores run the risk of having their spells fizzle. Roll percentile dice every time the priest casts a spell; if the number rolled is less than or equal to the listed chance for spell failure, the spell is expended with absolutely no effect whatsoever. (111) (Emphasis mine. Page reference from the Player's Handbook (1995); your page numbers may vary.) In other words, in Dungeons & Dragons the term—so far as I can tell originally—was shorthand for what happens when a spell is used but does nothing. The Player's Handbook uses the term again later on Casting Spells but descriptively: [I]f the spellcaster is struck by a weapon or fails to make a saving throw before the spell is cast, the caster's concentration is disrupted. The spell is lost in a fizzle of useless energy and is wiped clean from the memory of the caster until it can be rememorized. (23) (Emphasis mine.) Unfamiliar as I am with the tournament scene at the time, I can't speak to whether the term fizzle was used earlier than 1989 in live settings. By way of personal experience, my last Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Second Edition campaign was nearly two decades ago, and, while I played a wizard for a decade in that campaign, I've no recollection of any of my PC's interrupted spells fizzling—we just used the word failed. The Player's Handbooks (2000 and 2003) for 3e and 3.5e each use the word fizzle once in a similar descriptive context to the word's second use in Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition: "[T]he spell fizzles with no effect" (125 and 140, respectively). Note: To go further afield, I suspect the increased popularity of the term fizzle comes from Magic: The Gathering which had a rule about when spells fizzle in one of its early rulebooks. (I think circa 1998 with the original Urza block, but I can't confirm this.) Although the term is considered archaic now, the shared player base of both Wizards of the Coast's major properties can't be ignored.
394169	The title of the previous show Avatar: The Last Airbender was accurate, the Fire Nation had wiped out all Airbenders while Aang was frozen. Tenzin and his 3 children are the only Airbenders left in Korra's time. In the S1E10, Turning the Tides, Lin refers to Tenzin and his kids as "the last airbenders". If you consider the Avatar: The Last Airbender comics canon, then there were some airbenders who survived the initial genocide. They were later lured with the hope of sanctuary, and killed by Admiral Zhao. The others dressed in that garb are Air Acolytes, who are people who seek to maintain the Air Nomad's culture while the Airbender population (hopefully) increases. They do not have the ability to bend.
553759	Have you gone to a library? You might have, and might have observed that the books on same topic are in same stack. Let chemists be the librarian of the library of elements. And he has got to arrange his elements into stacks. Okay? Chemist 1: How do I reduce the disorder in the arrangement of the these elements? Chemist 2: Umm ... we need some criteria. According to that criteria, we will stack the elements. Chemist 3: Let the criterion be electronic configuration. Chemist 4 (looks at you): Do you know about subshells and orbitals? Welcome to the world — sorry, shell — of electrons! An electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom’s nucleus. The closest shell to the nucleus is called the “1 shell” (also called “K shell”), followed by the “2 shell” (or “L shell”), then the “3 shell” (or “M shell”), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond with the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) or are labelled alphabetically with letters used in the X-ray notation (K, L, M, …). Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons. The electron shells are labelled K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q; or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; going from innermost shell outwards. Electrons in outer shells have higher average energy and travel farther from the nucleus than those in inner shells. Each shell is composed of one or more subshells, which are themselves composed of atomic orbitals. For example, the first (K) shell has one subshell, called 1s; the second (L) shell has two subshells, called 2s and 2p; the third shell has 3s, 3p, and 3d; the fourth shell has 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f. Each s subshell holds at most 2 electrons. Each p subshell holds at most 6 electrons. Each d subshell holds at most 10 electrons. Each f subshell holds at most 14 electrons. Row 1 contains only the elements that have only the K shell occupied*. Row 2 contains only the elements that have only the K and L shells occupied*. Row 3 contains only the elements that have only the K, L and M shells occupied*. And so on. * Occupied means that shell may or may not be filled, but there certainly are some electrons.
553809	Background The general arrangement of The Periodic Table is a result of the orbitals available to electrons bound to a single, isolated nucleus. Each orbital is described by a wave function, which is a regular function (similar to polynomials familiar to high school algebra) with respect to the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates of space, and describes the behavior of the electrons occupying it. We can find these wave functions (and equivalently: the orbitals) by solving the Schrödinger Equation, which is a differential equation describing the system: one electron orbiting one proton in the case of hydrogen. A system with more than one electron is actually impossible to solve exactly, so we usually just think about hydrogen orbitals. The set of orbitals for any other element is more or less the same as that for hydrogen--just with different energies--so your question can be answered by considering hydrogen alone. Specifics Electrons in these orbitals have 4 characteristics, and no two electrons belonging to a single nucleus can have matching values for all 4 (The Pauli Exclusion Principle): Size Shape Orientation Spin For hydrogen: the size contains all of the information about the energy of the orbital. Denoted by the letter $n$. The shape reflects the angular momentum of the orbital. Denoted by $l$. The orientation reflects one (of three) components of the angular momentum, as a convention: the z-coordinate. Denoted by $m_l$. Unless you care about magnetism, the spin is only important because it allows you to put 2 electrons in one orbital (due to Pauli's principle). Denoted by $m_s$. Since there is an energy associated with angular momentum, the possible values of $l$ for any electron is constrained by its value of $n$. For example: if $n=2$, only $l=1$ and $l=0$ are possible. In the case of the first row elements (in their ground states): $n=1$ so $l=0$ without exception. The numbers of elements in the other rows are a result of rules governing possible orientations, $m_l$, of the orbitals (keeping in mind Pauli's principle, and that two spots are available per orbital due to spin, $m_s$). In case you're curious: if an electron has angular momentum $l=1$, the z-component of its angular momentum, $m_l$ can only have the values $1$, $0$ or $-1$. For $l=2$, $m_l=\{2,1,0,-1,-2\}$, and for the first row: $l=0$ implies that $m_l=0$ without exception. If you write out the number of possible orbitals following these rules: $$n=\{1,2,3,...\}$$ $$n \gt l \ge 0$$ $$+l \ge m_l \ge -l$$ $$m_s=\{-1/2,+1/2\}$$ ...where $n$ corresponds to the row number on The Periodic Table, you will find the pattern that you mentioned in your question.

651584	There are many ways to answer this question. Basically, your choice is to use either 1) a physically-based model 2) a statistical model 3) a blend of the two (Kalman filter). Since you ask the question here, I assume you opted for 2. Do you have good reasons for that? If so, you need to fit a statistical model to your data, and use it to make predictions. You have 24 stations so a spatiotemporal model is warranted. How wide an area do they cover? How many different climate regimes are there? That will determine how complicated a spatial model you need. The temporal component of that could well be ARIMA: it's often a reasonable choice. Where did you get the idea that it only applied to seasonal data? Whatever you do, the atmospheric concentration of $CO_2$ has to be one of your predictors. If your data show a big trend from 1970 to present, $CO_2$ is the most likely culprit. Other indices of regional climate variability may be relevant too; depends on your region: where are your stations located?
1004495	Some (many) years ago, their Prism converter was good. Now they use their website to hack your computer - or so it seems. I simply updated what I had installed from them (Prism) and then decided to browse through the options...And there was the "TOOLBOX" with very short descriptions of what it supposed to offer. I clicked few links - nothing told me that I am installing applications. A bit later, while I was searching the web, a window comes up asking if I want to change my default searcg engine. I answered "NO" - and shortly after that I see a whole bunch of photoediting, sound-conversion, slide who and hell know what else installed on my computer. To top it off – the home page of both browsers I use changed to NCH, the Google Toolbar was replaced with something from NCH – of course, without anyone asking my permission. And that is with antivirus running. When I tried to uninstall the unwanted software using Windows Control Panel, the programs refused to uninstall, informing that I should finish the previuos "installation". (probably, another malicious code did not finish running by the time I switched off the internet connection just in case). I removed the NCH add-on in Firefox, changed the home page back to what it was – but when I restart Firefox, everything is back – which means the NCH gadgets and their home page. I had better luck with Explorer – there it cleaned up the NCH from the first try. Now back to uninstalling. I found the NCH folder and in the subfolders there (some 5 or 7 of them) were separate uninstallers for each one of their wonderful programs. Just one of them worked – the rest asked you for a feedback, tell you that all is uninstalled – and nothing changed. So I cleaned the registry with regedit – searching for "NCH Software" and other names in their folders and deleting each one of them. Still did not fix the Firefox. Now I have to run a deep virus scan and perhaps, restore the system to some previous points.
1338390	Yes, some diodes in the package shown will comfortably be able to handle 1 kV reverse standoff, and 10 Amperes forward current, at a typical ~1 Volt forward voltage. The two values are not applicable simultaneously, the first is for blocking and the second is for conduction. Adding a heat sink, a simple copper band looped around the diode body, would be recommended - The diode datasheet if you had one would typically tell you thermal dissipation ratings and required heat sinking for the rated forward current. I have some unmarked high power Schottky diodes in a similar package that can cope with 15 Amperes sustained current flow in forward bias, and the real problem I'm seeing is solder melting and flowing at the PCB junctions every now and then.
1649123	It turns out (he answered himself) that this functionality can be adjusted with CompizConfig Settings Manager. (To install CompizConfig, enter sudo aptitude install compizconfig-settings-manager from a terminal. It's also, as of this writing, available through the Ubuntu Software Centre.) To adjust the transparency of non-active windows (note these instructions have only been tested on version 14.04): Start CompizConfig. Go to the Effects menu (either click on Effects in the left pane or click All and scroll to the Effects section) Click TrailFocus. Its description is "Adjust the opacity, saturation and brightness of windows based on when they last had focus." Here you can choose either The Behaviour tab, to configure which window types (e.g. toolbar, utility, dialog, normal) that TrailFocus will affect the number of windows that TrailFocus will track (beyond which number it will consider a window "completly (sic) unfocused") which window in the switcher stack to start fading The Appearance tab, to configure the opacity, brightness and saturation levels of both focused and unfocused windows
2219998	I personally highly recommend using an alcohol stove (pepsi-can stove, or some other variant), especially when hiking solo. In my opinion, the weight benefits far exceed the disadvantages. The benefits of Alcohol*: An alcohol stove is usually much lighter than a comparable white gas/propage/kerosene/gasoline. An alcohol stove also has no moving parts that can malfunction. Quite reliable. Can be easily made even in the field, using two soda cans and a sharp knife. Alcohol is relatively easy to come by and better available than most butane canisters Disadvantages: Usually takes longer to boil water than more traditional stoves. In higher altitudes/colder weather it takes longer to prime the stove and get it going. In such conditions it will also take longer to boil the water/meal. (*We are talking about stove fuel here, not about drinking the stuff...)
2247931	The major intervals 2, 3, 6, and 7 come indeed from the major scale. However, as you noted, the corresponding minor intervals do not come from the (natural) minor scale, because then there wouldn't be any minor 2nd interval. All minor intervals can be obtained from the descending major scale. If we use C major as an example, a minor 2nd is the interval between C and the B below the C. A minor third is the interval from C down to A, a minor 6th from C down to E, and, finally, a minor seventh from C down to D. Equivalently, you get all the minor intervals (2, 3, 6, 7) from the phrygian mode, which is an inverted major scale in the sense that the sequence of intervals when ascending is the same as the sequence of intervals of a descending major scale.
2371424	I've already answered this question, but this is a different answer; I've recently started using a website called Strava (they do also have iPhone/Android apps as well as accepting GPX uploads which can be generated by many platforms and devices - I use MotionX-GPS for the iPhone). Their (I think unique) central point is to allow users to defined specific 'segments' of their ride and then anyone whose uploaded route passes over that segment is included in a virtual league table. This allows you to easily compare yourself to others over short routes, climbs, sprints and so on. So long as you cycle in reasonably populated areas, you'll be amazed at how many segments your ride already covers, at least around the London area, I was. (I've no connection to the website, apart from being a satisfied, paying customer.)
2377199	The parts that Blam refers to are known as the pawls and the ratchet inside the freehub. Slipping can happen for a number of reasons, including worn ratchet, worn pawls, weak springs, or excessive accumulation of grease & grime within the freehub. http://dirtmountainbike.com/features/work-freehub-body.html has a thorough explanation of the different freehub types. Depending on the hub you have, a repair consists of either cleaning, rebuilding or replacing the freehub. Some freehubs are rebuildable, others are not and must be replaced as a unit. That said, it's often possible to extend the life of a non-rebuildable freehub by flushing out the old grease & gunk and regreasing. The mechanic at your local bike shop can almost certainly take care of this for you. If you're more of the do-it-yourself type, http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/freehub-service has step-by-step instructions for several different freehub types.
2380376	If your main worry is being seen by cars, then a superbright light isn't really the way forward. Besides being dazzling/blinding, a front light does very little for visibility from the sides and from behind, from which many (most?) collisions occur. A front light helps your visibility mainly when a car pulls out of or turns into a side road across your path while you approach. In my experience, in most of these cases the problem isn't that the driver didn't see me, but that they had difficulties judging my speed. Also, these are cases where I can mitigate some of the risk by reading the situation, observing the car (are they starting to move?) and being ready to brake. A front light doesn't protect you against close overtakes, right hooks (UK: left hooks) and all the other frequent types of collisions. If you are worried about visibility, then it's better to wear hi-vis and add reflectors or possibly several smaller, cheap lights on different parts of the bike. For the driver, one superbright light is just one point, whereas hi-vis, reflectors and several smaller lights will outline the shape and size of your bicycle and help drivers to judge distance and speed. I've also seen the suggestion to have a small light on the top tube that points at yourself to light up your own shape. The only real use for a very bright light is a dark unlit path (without pedestrians) where you want to see where you're going. If you go along unlit paths a lot, I would invest in a light with a proper shaped beam, like the B&M models, that light up the path properly but don't dazzle other users. I agree with everybody else that dazzling other users is a very bad idea, for many reasons (your own safety as well as etiquette).
271822	Because every living being still generates mana, as long as it is alive Whatever is living, for the same fact that it is alive, accumulates mana. The old machines kept the beings alive for thousands of years, which means that it could extract whatever mana they had at the beginning of the process, plus whatever mana they could generate (of course a smaller amount than in free life) in the course of the following years. Say that a being has 1.000 mana when it is captured. An amount of 2 mana per year is extracted from it, but in the meantime, it still could generate 1 mana per year. This means that you will need about 1.000+t-2t=0, so t=1.000 years to be depleted, while the evil lord has gained a total of 2.000 mana. Part of this is leaked, let's say 10%, so that the net amount is 1.800 mana. If the new model can extract 100 mana per year, the time for a full depletion will be a little more than 10 years, and the lord will gain 1.010 mana (without leak). So, at the beginning, the evil lord will be happy, because he will see an improved flow of mana, but when the process reaches its operating speed, he will discover that the average amount has been basically halved...
337937	Elves cannot naturally grow a beard Elves do not grow facial hair, according to the D&D 5th edition's Player's Handbook (p.21): Elves have no facial and little body hair. The item description says: you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you're capable of growing one Therefore, an elf cannot grow a beard even with this particular item. Although half-elves are described as able to grow beards, I'm unaware of any D&D product of any edition featuring a full elf with a natural beard. Earlier editions You asked in the comments about how elf chins were handled in previous editions of the game. D&D 4th edition's Player's Handbook (p.41) is less clear than its 5th edition counterpart, but the 4th edition book Wizards Presents Races and Classes confirms that male elves don't have beards: Elves retain several of their distinguishing characteristics from earlier editions, most notably the pointed ears and the slight tilt to the eyes. And male elves don't have facial hair. Remarkably, D&D 3rd edition actually has an explicit rule covering this case: elves cannot grow beards, but in at least one case, dwarven magic which causes beard growth still affects them normally. According to Magic of Faerun, p.117, the spell silverbeard: Your beard grows and turns to pure and magically hardened silver, increasing the armor bonus of your armor by +2. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants an AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. If you do not have a beard, you grow one for the duration of this spell (even if you are a creature that cannot normally grow a beard, such as an elf or a female human). You get a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against dwarves. Since the Forgotten Realms setting generally remains consistent between game editions, it is reasonably likely that the elves' complete inability to grow a beard described (rather than some kind of strict racial tradition of shaving regularly) also applies to the elves other editions of D&D, at least for that world. Editions prior to 3rd are unclear as to whether elves have beards. In AD&D 1st and 2nd edition's respective core rulebooks they are not described as having beards, but neither are they described as unable to grow beards in those editions of the game.
391438	JKR has said that Draco was "sobered" by his experience as a Death Eater, and that he does not owe Harry a life debt. Draco marries Astoria Greengrass, the younger sister of Daphne Greengrass, Draco's classmate. They have one son named Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, who JKR has said has a lot to overcome, not the least of which is his name (she meant Malfoy; I thought Scorpius was worse than Malfoy ;). Draco is never a "nice man." He does acknowledge Harry in the Epilogue with a curt nod; JKR says that under no circumstances could Draco and Harry be friends. Here's a funny quote about Draco: Q: Does Malfoy owe Harry a debt? JKR: That's a great question and a lot of people wanted to know that. When Dumbledore said to Harry, Voldemort won't want a close associate who is in your debt, I wasn't implying by that there was any kind of magical bond there. It was more that Dumbldore's extensive wisdom and knowledge of human nature, he knew as Harry later thinks in book seven, he knew that Pettigrew would react a certain way to having saved his life. ... He's weak, fundamentally weak. Pettigrew is a very weak character. He's not someone I like at all. He's a weak person and he likes to gravitate to people who are stronger. Dumbledore is right. Pettigrew had an impulsive mercy... would Malfoy be in Harry's debt? I think the very worst burden Harry could have put Malfoy under was this one, that Malfoy has to feel any kind of gratitude. So I tried to show that slightly in the epilogue when they look slightly at each other and there's a, "Hi. It's so embarrassing, you saved my life. No one will ever let me forget it." I think, does he owe him a debt, probably not. I think Malfoy would go back to being an improved version of what he was but we shouldn't expect him to be a really great guy any time soon. JK Rowling at Carnegie Hall 10.20.07
478749	I think they could get into Hogwarts because Myrtle’s parents (who were muggles) got into Hogwarts to get her body. if Muggle parents can’t get into Hogwarts, how do they visit their child if a Muggle-born got into the Triwizard Tournament? So, yes: Muggle parents could get into Hogwarts but only if needed. I don’t think there’s a parent-teacher meeting at Hogwarts because - well, what would they speak about? Especially to the Muggle parents. ‘Your son got Troll for Transfigurations and failed to transform a rat to a goblet and vice-versa’? It would be an interesting conversation, though. Maybe they’d just send out a letter like how the Ministry did in OoTP.
547744	I'm no expert nor scholar, but from what I am reading in all of these explanations, and what I notice from the illustration, it becomes obvious...at least to me...which I feel may clarify the polarity change between the Galvanic cell and electrolytic cell for this user. As established and understood, the source of electrons and transfer of ions flows from the negative pole, (Anode) and is received by the positive pole (Cathode) (intentionally using most basic terms) the anode is negative here because the the flow originates FROM the electrolyte, into the light bulb, for which, if the terminals of the bulb were labeled, they would match the electrolyte in the other cell as it is the force coming from the bulb pushing the flow to the cell's cathode, and the cell's cathode is pulling from the bulb. In the electrolytic cell, the "electrolyte" is taking the role of the light bulb of the Galvanic cell, since the electrons are being SENT TO it from the power source, and is not in itself the SOURCE of flow, but is SUBJECT TO the force from the source of flow. SO just as the Galvanic cell's anode sends to the light bulb, and the electrolyte is labeled like the load of the galvanic cell, and transferring its incoming negative force from the current source, and this pushes through the electrolyte like the flow FROM the light bulb. It may be easier if you note that the SOURCE of power is NOT the electrolyte and technically, the black terminal of the power supply is the TRUE anode (Sending), and the red side the TRUE Cathode, (Receiving) but when identifying the reactive substance submerged/surrounded by the electrolytic substance, the anode is giving up its ions, which then add to the Cathode which is receiving them. Therefore the tags in the electrolytic cell are not naming the "source of flow", but the reaction of the substances involved, due TO the force/flow imposed on them from the power source, but is not THE source of power, and therefore should not be labeled AS one...and there are only two options for labeling them, and since it cannot be changed at the power source it can only b changed at the point of contact with the electrolyte! At least this is what I have come to understand by reviewing the comments and illustrations. I sincerely hope it helps clarify the rationale for the reversal of labels for this user and any others struggling with the concept of being due to the source of current having to be labeled as - Anode and + Cathode... forcing the object the current plays upon to be the opposite despite their poles and due to direction of flow.
588566	The 95% is not numerically attached at all to how confident you are that you've covered the true effect in your experiment. Perhaps recognizing that "interval using 95% coverage range calculation" might be a more accurate name for it. You can make the choice to decide that the interval contains the true value; and you'll be right if you do that consistently 95% of the time. But you really don't know how likely it is for your particular experiment without more information. Q1: Your first query conflates two things and misuses a term. No wonder you're confused. A narrower confidence interval may be more precise but, when calculated the same way, such as the 95% method, they all have the same accuracy. They capture the true value the same proportion of the time. Also, just because it's narrow doesn't mean you're less likely to encounter a sample that falls within that narrow confidence interval. A narrow confidence interval can be achieved one of three ways. The experimental method or nature of the data could just have very low variance. The confidence interval around the boiling point of tap water at sea level is pretty small, regardless of the sample size. The confidence interval around the average weight of people might be rather large because people are very variable but one can make that confidence interval smaller by just acquiring more observations. In that case, as you gain more certainty about where you believe the true value is, by collecting more samples and making a narrower confidence interval, then the probability of encountering an individual in that confidence interval does go down. (it goes down in any case when you increase sample size, but you may not bother collecting the big sample in the boiling water case). Finally, it could be narrow because your sample is unrepresentative. In that case you are actually more likely to have one of the 5% of intervals that does not contain the true value. It's a bit of a paradox regarding CI width and something you should check by knowing the literature and how variable this data typically is. Further consider that the confidence interval is about trying to estimate the true mean value of the population. If you knew that spot on then you'd be even more precise (and accurate) and not even have a range of estimates. But your probability of encountering an observation with that exact same value would be far lower than finding one within any particular sample based CI. Q2: A 99% confidence interval is wider than a 95%. Therefore, it's more likely that it will contain the true value. See the distinction above between precise and accurate, you're conflating the two. If I make a confidence interval narrower with lower variability and higher sample size it becomes more precise, the likely values cover a smaller range. If I increase the coverage by using a 99% calculation it becomes more accurate, the true value is more likely to be within the range.
1035333	Their products appear to do what they say they will do, and as far as I can tell do them well -- I've tried them so I know. That's the good news. The bad news is when the installation runs it tries to install a load of things on your system that you didn't ask for and didn't want, such as IE toolbars. It tried to change my IE homepage (without asking!) but Spybot told me about it as it attempted this, so I stopped this. I didn't catch a few other things, such as hosing up Internet Explorer so that whenever I try to start a new tab, it doesn't come up blank, but it runs to Google Mail! Which is really odd, actually. Gmail was set as my home page, and apparently, preventing NCH from changing my home page caused it to mess IE's tab-generating process up. I am not sure how to fix this. It also installed the Ask Toolbar without my permission. I don't know what else it installed (I'm still looking). When I uninstalled their product (the screen capture program), it didn't totally clean up after itself, either. The NCH Software folder was still in Program Files. I suspect other remnants remain.
1270480	easiest thing is web search and read articles related to subnet mask and subnet mask binary shorthand and CIDR and also check out subnet calculators the /32 is the CIDR (shorthand) and refers to how many 1's are in the subnet mask. For /32 that is 255.255.255.255 or 11111111.11111111.11111111.1111111 that means you can only have one ip address, on your network before needing a gateway/router to get outside that network. with /32 it's just you. A subnet mask is a number that defines a range of IP addresses available within a network CIDR = classless inter-domain routing what does using /32 mean : I don't believe it is an invalid setting however it effectively turns off networking... or limits the network to just you... you can only talk to yourself if you don't have a gateway set up to reach outside that netmask. what will its network id be: I assume you mean what will ip address be, and ip address will be whatever you set it to be. The IP address and subnet mask (which is what you are dealing with) are two different although related things. can a host exist without a network id [ip address?] : can you exist without having a first and last name or without an address? yes the host can exist. kinda need to better define what u mean by exist.
1371323	As the data says it mates with a "standard banana". Standard is 4mm. Something like this: Or this: Not this (but perhaps you can see the resemblance in the springy bits): The part you have (female) is just a hollow tube with no springy parts, so it depends on the male to supply the compliance. Some plugs have a cross-drilled hole so another banana plug can be inserted sideways. The screw and nuts are to fasten onto a ring terminal or onto a through-hole PCB. In the case of the PCB, a toothed lockwasher is a good idea. In the case of the terminal, a toothed "star" terminal can be used (photo from here). You drill a hole as the datasheet shows and attach the jack to a panel with the large nut. The datasheet indicates that the jack also accepts shrouded plugs (insulated on the outside of the metal and often with plastic at the end so that a human finger cannot contact the metal). This is commonly used on the meter end of test leads.

204232	There are any number of purpose built survival rifles and shotguns (and both) to choose from. These are intended for downed aircrews in hostile territory to hunt small and medium game, as well as self-defense in a pinch. They're designed to be light, compact, durable, and easy to use. These are all desirable for a hunting weapon to be shipped on a colony ship where space and weight are a premium. The current version in US Air Force service is the AR-7. Its a magazine fed simple blowback semi-automatic rifle. It weighs just over 1kg, and with the barrel removed is about half a meter long. All parts store in the stock, and it will float. It has a peep sight making it very easy to aim. The AR-7 fires .22 Long Rifle, but .22 Hornet might be more desirable for a space colony. Both have minimal recoil, and are very quiet making them very forgiving for an untrained shooter. While both fire the same 3 gram projectile, .22 Hornet's muzzle velocity is almost 2.5 faster with 7 times the kinetic energy. The resulting flatter trajectory makes it easier to aim. And the additional energy makes it effective against medium game such as turkeys, pigs, and goats. .22 Hornet is about twice the size and weight of .22 LR meaning you can carry half as much. This is offset because .22 Hornet is centerfire and the brass case can be reloaded. .22 LR is a rimfire cartridge and it cannot be reloaded. The colonists can save weight by carrying a limited amount of brass cases, and an extra supply of gunpowder, projectiles, and primers to reload them. Eventually they'd manufacture their own, this is late-19th century technology. Unlike fancy sci-fi weapons, the colonists will be able to maintain this weapon and manufacture ammunition without high-tech facilities. This should be sufficient for day-to-day pest control, hunting, and self-defense. Packing many very light survival rifles means putting more weapons in the hands of more colonists. A handful of larger, heavier weapons would be on hand to deal with larger threats should they appear.
433990	Within the marvel universe I don't know. It's called Illeism Illeism /ˈɪli.ɪzəm/ (from Latin ille meaning "he, that") is the act of referring to oneself in the third person instead of first person. Illeism is sometimes used in literature as a stylistic device. In real life usage, illeism can reflect a number of different stylistic intentions or involuntary circumstances. As far as I know its' not revealed in canon, but we can surmise: Mantis is of Asian ancestry (obviously): The enigmatic Mantis traces her roots back to the family of Vietnamese crimelord Monsieur Khruul who, disapproving of his sister Lua's marriage to German mercenary Gustav Brandt, hunted the couple across Indochina¹. ¹Source Created by Steve Englehart who also create the other martial arts expert Shang Chi indicating that he must have at least a cursory acquaintance with Asian customs. Look at this question it's not unheard of as a speech mechanism. Aside: Mantis will apparently feature in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. In October 2015, del Toro was confirmed to return and Pom Klementieff was cast as Mantis.
500869	The main thing about a Bridge camera is that it's "Bridging" the gap between a small point & shoot camera, and a larger DSLR. So the comparison of a bridge camera to a DSLR comes down, basically, to the following:- A larger optical zoom lens like a DSLR. Versatile, but not interchangeable. The sensor is generally not as advanced as a dedicated DSLR, and therefore Bridge cameras tend not to handle low light/high ISO situations as well as a DSLR (but better than a P&S). You won't get an optical viewfinder on a Bridge camera. It will be either an LCD display only or an EVF-Electronic Viewfinder (which mean when you look into the viewfinder eyehole you see the image of what the lens is seeing, as captured by the sensor, rather than the true image as reflected by a mirror). Of course, by its very definition, an SLR will have an optical viewfinder. A Bridge camera will generally have similar controls and handling to a DSLR, and be complete with Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Speed Priority and Manual exposure programs, just as you would get on a DSLR and high-end compacts. You are usually able to shoot in RAW just like on DSLR's and high-end compacts. A good article on Bridge cameras can be found here. From personal experience, my old Boss once asked me about some issues he was having with his Fujifilm Bridge camera. Indoor photos of his daughter, when viewed at 100% had absolutely horrible red marks all over the photo - especially in the skin tones. So much so that even viewing at a reasonable smaller size on the monitor resulted in noticable red 'grain' in the photo. I took the camera and tried lots of things with it, but was unable to correct the fault. He asked me for a recommendation and (at that time) I suggested the Canon Powershot S90. He got one, and never had any problems with the photos from it. So if you are considering a Bridge camera - it may be worth instead to look at a high-end compact instead. As an aside I once heard it said that with Bridge cameras you essentially get the disadvantages of both systems -- the size and weight of a DSLR and the lack of flexibility of a point & shoot. I quite like the saying, but it's an individual viewpoint. Many people have Bridge cameras and are very happy with them.
725847	At the very least, you should have your name, contact information, and a bio of what you do. That's the minimal advertising necessary to serve as a useful "see my site for more details on what I do". Given that almost everyone who visits your site will either be looking for someone's name or a paper you've previously published, the next most useful information to include would be: - Lab members contact info & bios - Publications with downloadable links I would definitely recommend putting pictures up as well, so people will recognize your face when they see you at conferences. Same for lab members. Links to other affiliations is nice, but almost certainly not important. Practically no one will follow them. Whether to list your CV is up to you; people who need it will often ask you, but it won't hurt to have it live. Depending on your research, you can have a "recent news" section where you advertise any particularly notable publication or mention in the popular press. Finally, if you teach, I recommend putting links to the course website (which may or may not be part of your academic website), as many students will find your page by googling and will be looking for course info.
956499	The difference between the CPU fan and the system fan is that the former is the one attached to the heatsink of the processor, and the latter is generally on one of the sides of the case to exhaust hot air. The BIOS determines which is which, though, by the mere fact that one is plugged to the cpu_fan plug of the mainboard and the other is on the sys_fan, so it could be reversed without much problem if one would have any occult reason to do so (or just a broken plug). You can safely use the computer without a sys_fan as long as the cpu and the other components run at temperatures inside their safety ranges, which is quite probable that they do, even without system fan, as long as the computer isn't under heavy load or naturally power hungry.
1369460	The rating 2600mAh (or 2.6Ah) means the battery will produce 2600mA for one hour, or 1000mA for 2.6 hours of indeed 1mA for 2600 hours. The rating is the current multiplied by the time the battery can produce that current. In practice the rating depends on the current. The figure of 2600mAh will have been obtained for whatever current is optimal for that battery. Running at higher or lower current will give a shorter lifetime. Incidentally, the 9.62Wh rating is the current times the voltage times the time. So in this case the voltage times the current times the lifetime is 9.62Wh. If the battery voltage $V$ was constant the 9.62Wh would just be the 2.6Ah times $V$ (so presumably the battery voltage is around 3.7V). However the battery voltage changes as the battery discharges, so the relationship between the Wh and Ah ratings is a bit more complicated than this. As for your questions about charging, it's impossible to comment without knowing exactly what sort of battery it is. If it is a 3.7V battery that sounds like a lithium ion battery, in which case you may well have cooked it by connecting it to a 12V PSU. Lithium batteries need a special charger. It might be worth you asking on the Electrical Engineering SE as they tend to be more interested in the nitty gritty of anything electrical. But if you do post there be sure to give as many details about the battery as possible.
2242707	A good digital piano is better than a bad acoustic piano. The best digital pianos aren't as good as the best acoustic pianos. As a beginner, it's unlikely that you have the skill and experience to detect the nuance and detail that separates a good digital piano from a great acoustic piano. Pretty much anything made by a reputable brand and marketed as a "digital piano" (as opposed to a "keyboard" etc.) will have a keyboard feel that's close enough to a real piano for a beginner. Remember too that real pianos vary dramatically in feel. If you choose a real piano, you should factor in the cost of maintenance. Real pianos need regular tuning; an out-of-tune piano is no pleasure to play, nor to listen to. Digital pianos never go out of tune, and require very little maintenance. In favour of real pianos, there's nothing quite like taking the covers off a real piano, watching the intricate mechanisms, getting the full sound of the uncovered strings, seeing them vibrate, plucking or muting with your hands, etc.
2244534	One side effect of an upwards stroke is that you'll normally only hit the highest couple of strings. This upwards stroke starts at the highest strings, and (as cyco130 said) is usually a lot weaker, which means that you'll only hit two or three strings at most. More than that will usually sound clumsy, unless you really intend to go for that particular sound. A good example of that is the opening chords to Pink Floyd's Welcome to the Machine. Anyone will notice that those sound fairly peculiar, and that's because they're struck upwards. Since it's difficult to hit the lower sounding strings properly in an upwards stroke, you'll often see people striking every chord downwards, when the lower strings are most important. For this, a good example is Pennywise's Bro Hymn, a song that most people will immediately recognize. This song's riff consists entirely out of power chords, on the lower four strings, and each strike has almost the same force to it. The only way to achieve that sound is by striking every chord downwards, over and over again.
44283	Early as adverb means before the usual or expected time; earlier means before the present time or before the time one is referring to. So, the second sentence could be understood as asking to come before the present time. For example, if it's 10:00 AM when the question is asked, the other person could take you are asking to come a little earlier than 10:00 AM. The exact meaning depends on the context, though. For example, in the following sentence, the meaning would be different. Yesterday we met at 10:00 PM. Can you come over earlier, so we can go back home before my wife returns from work? I would use early if I am talking of the usual time I do something, or I am talking of the expected time something should happen. For example, if I am talking to a co-worker, I could ask Can you come early, tomorrow? to ask if my co-worker can come earlier than the usual time he starts to work.
455542	This is probably one of the books from the Pit Dragon trilogy by Jane Yolen, specifically the second one, Heart's Blood. Golden, Jakkin, and Akki flee to the mountains, but Golden is badly injured. Pursued by the Wardens, they are forced to leave Golden behind in a cave which they had sheltered in during Dark After, using Heart's Blood's body as a door and heater. Jakkin manumits the traitorous Erikkin, and Heart's Blood dies from a stinger shot in the neck, her body saving Jakkin and Akki. The only shelter they have during Dark After, is Heart's Blood's body, so they crawl into her birth sac. In the morning, Jakkin and Akki are reborn out of the dragon blood, and became the first real human Austarians, linked to each other and Heart's Blood's five hatchlings. Jakkin and Akki are male and female. Dragons are common on Austar IV. Jakkin and Akki gain special powers by nesting in the birth sac, but it's the ability to communicate with each other as dragons do. And, from the Google Books excerpt: Jakkin added, "They can't be ridden. With a weight on Heart's Blood's back she couldn't even raise her wings. And if you sat there without a saddle of some sort, your legs and groin would be slashed terribly by her scales. The scales move when she moves, and they slice at a touch."
497368	in fact if the lens front element rotates when focusing, then the petal lens hood is not good idea. I have a cheap Tamron 70-300 telezoom lens and it is shipped with standard "tube" hood. Second, the one you found looks like the one with screw-thread. I think that Canon also uses bayonet mount for hoods like my Pentax. So as I needed hood for my 18-55 mm lens, I first looked on Pentax website and found that the original hood is called "PH-RBA". Then I searched ebay and found some replacement hood for much smaller price, which had in description "Lens Hood for PENTAX SMC DA 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 AL II Lens replaces PH-RBA 52mm" and it had the same bayonet mount as the original lens hood.
520161	To understand the difference between a bridge camera and a DSLR, it is really necessary to understand the origin of the term "bridge camera". While a DSLR (digital single lens reflex) is a particular type of camera with a very well defined meaning (it uses a single lens which is used for both exposure and viewfinding), the term "bridge" simply means that it is bridging the gap between two different types of cameras. So, knowing that "bridge" camera is simply a marketing term, what was it that it was designed to be a bridge from and to? Traditionally there were two main types of cameras, your point and shoot cameras, which were designed to be small, simple to use, and basic for an average person to be able to take photographs. Historically, they typically had a fixed lens, a basic built in flash if any and a simple viewfinder that simply gave you an idea of what the lens would capture when you exposed the image. If present at all, settings like shutter speed were minimal. On the other side, you had interchangeable lens cameras with full ability to adjust (either manually or automatically) settings like shutter speed, aperture, focal length, etc. These cameras were much more advanced, generally larger and generally more complicated to use, especially outside of using automatic settings. SLRs are one example of this type of camera. Early on, the differences were more pronounced, however as cameras advanced, both of these extremes moved more towards the center. Point and shoot cameras now often do allow basic exposure adjustments to be made and the automatic shooting capability of DSLRs have made them much simpler for a novice to use and get ok results, however some of the advantages and disadvantages have remained. Generally, point and shoots still are smaller and lighter and DSLRs have far greater versatility and generally better image quality due to larger sensors and better optics. So, knowing those two extremes, a bridge camera means that it is a camera which specializes on trying to provide the advantages of both DSLRs and point and shoot cameras with as few of the disadvantages as they can. They are also sometimes referred to as hybrid cameras. Typically, they are larger than basic point and shoots and have lenses that have adjustable focal length, but they are typically not removable lenses. They generally use an electronic view finder to avoid the complexity of SLR optics. They generally have smaller sensors than a DSLR, but often larger than a typical point and shoot, so they split the difference in size and versatility without having all of the cost or complexity of a DSLR, but also with more versatility than a basic point and shoot. The exact differences will depend on the particular models you are comparing and some high end bridge cameras may actually perform better than cheap DSLRs in some situations, but the general idea is simply that they straddle the gap left between the design goals of a point and shoot and those of a DSLR. Perhaps the most consistent distinction in terms of what is being bridged is that of the level of control the camera gives the user. Ultimately, simple cameras tend to have simpler and more limited controls while high end cameras give the user direct control of every aspect of image capture. Bridge cameras sit in between the extremes of super simple with no control and complete control over every aspect of image creation. A more recent introduction to the space is mirrorless cameras which could arguably be considered a type of bridge camera, at least on the lower end (though they aren't typically called as such) as well since they feature generally smaller sensors and simplified bodies from those of DSLRs, but include interchangeable lens systems to improve versatility and quality over that of a bridge camera with a permanently installed lens. I would say that higher end mirrorless cameras could not be considered bridge as they have strong support for full lighting, exposure and lens selection control and are no longer really a bridge between almost no control and full control, but rather provide full control. So to break down the gamut of cameras, from simplest to most complex, you have the following: Point and Shoot / Compact - smallest size, most basic adjustments, cheapest, easiest to use Conventional Bridge/Hybrid - slightly larger, generally more adjustments, but often menu driven, zoom lens, but permanently attached, still very easy to use Mirrorless - still a small size. Camera body nearly resembles a point and shoot, however lenses are interchangeable. More adjustment options available. Often full adjustment is available, but may still use menus for some settings, more complicated to use as you need to consider lens selection and possibly exposure adjustments DSLR - large size, generally better image quality, full adjustments directly available on higher end models, most complicated bodies and thus generally most expensive, similar shooting complexity to mirrorless since full consideration of exposure, lens, lighting selections need to be considered That isn't a perfect list as there is cross over depending on how high end a particular model is, but it serves as a general guideline. Ultimately, when you are considering which camera to buy, you should look at the capabilities of the camera and your needs rather than considering if it is labeled as a "bridge" camera. Look for a camera that can get the shots you want and let you adjust what you want while taking care of the rest for you.
565061	Granite is not composed of the oxides listed, they are just a way of expressing the weight percentage of elements in the sample. Granite (and other rocks) are actually composed of minerals. All granites contain quartz + alkali feldspar + plagioclase feldspar. Biotite is also pretty common and a variety of other minerals can also be less commonly present. This is a phase diagram of the quartz - alkali feldspar - plagioclase feldspar system at 5 kbar pressure. The first melt forms in this system at the eutectic point at around 650 °C, but complete melting would not occur until a much higher temperature. I expect the last thing to melt would be left over quartz although it would first transform to tridymite and then cristobalite before melting finally melting.
640486	Or is the shape more complicated? Restricted cubic splines fit flexible functions to different sections of the data; cubic spline design matrices can be estimated with OLS. MARS accomplishes a similar effect (different models for different subsets of points), but discovers the subset locations on its own. Splines build up from this idea: a data set can be partitioned into different intervals, and each of those intervals can be modeled with some degree of accuracy as a constant. Alternatively, you can model each interval as a linear function. Still more elaborately, you can make the linear functions continuous at the interval boundaries. These boundaries are "knots." This solution is a piece-wise linear model. Restricted cubic splines further enforce that the function have several orders of differentiability at the knots, and that the function be linear in the intervals $(-\infty, k_1],[k_n,\infty)$, i.e. "outside" of the last knots. This linearity requirement is motivated by a desire to not over-extrapolate in very data-sparse regions. Restricted cubic splines allow for non-monotonic functions, e.g. the function can increase and then decrease and then increase again. How to select knot locations is a sticky wicket, since it will influence what the ultimate model looks like. Frank Harrell's book Regression Modeling Strategies has some recommendations based on quantiles.
