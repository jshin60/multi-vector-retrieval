1039352	HDMI, like most modern cable interfaces, was designed to support hotplugging. The HDMI connector uses pin 19 as "Hot plug detect".
948845	What client are you referring to ? Teradata's download page has a list of drivers and access modules - most of which have a Linux version.
1017220	I installed their Prism Converter: it hijacked the file association to -ZIP which downloaded their own NCH unzipper. This is trojan practices.

2118227	Blacklist the read request. get is not SFTP protocol request. That's OpenSSH sftp client command that internally uses open, read and close requests.
108123	Several options: "Serious" or "major". In the US, crimes are divided into "felony" and "misdemeanor" (but these are technical legal terms, not a matter of opinion)
2142620	buddybuzzer is a cool app for Android. It doesn't have too many things to confuse. Have some added features like ring notification. Simple but useful.

100122	I would consider the sentence more cohesive without the comma. However, in more formal writing you could insert the comma, it just depends on your writing style.
993410	You can use devilspie to handle several behaviours under your Gnome's window manager, for instance the "always on top" you are searching for. Here's an example.
1914550	Looks like Samba 4 only, and that version isn't in squeeze or squeeze-backports. You may be able to backport it yourself from unstable or experimental, though.
433584	Because Darth Vader (aka Anakin Skywalker) is Leia's father. And Kylo Ren Is also the son of Leia. It takes two to tango.

1552434	I found the answer. Use the command metacity --replace. I am surprised that I didn't recieve a response to such a simple question! Well, at least I earned the tumbleweed badge :)
23	"Nope" is informal. You wouldn't usually want to use it, for example, answering questions for a job interview, but it would be an appropriate answer to a friend's question "Have you seen that movie yet?"
1919693	It seems to be saying that you have conflict markers still in your code. That means lines of ">>>>", "<<<<" and "====". This is probably because you had a conflict and simply marked it as resolved without actually resolving it.

2428213	The negative battery terminal was damaged. There was poor grounding, which did not lead to complete loss of power in the car, but was enough to stall the engine.. The car is working fine after replacing the terminal.
551773	A Lewis acid can accept a pair of electrons from a Lewis base. The boron in BF3 is electron poor and has an empty orbital, so it can accept a pair of electrons, making it a Lewis acid.
402986	If the only blood connection to the Starks is from 1000 years ago, then there must be thousands of Stark descendants with stronger claims - 2nd, 3rd or 4th degree cousins to Rob, the North must be teeming with them.
789179	Yes, absolutely add it, along with the publications that resulted. And, you should consider getting a letter of recommendation from the professor. Your lack of formal affiliation is of no consequence. It is the work that matters. Don't hesitate here.
886825	They're "protected" for this exact reason. They don't want you to move them to your computer. You'd have to look into some kind of DRM circumvention, and I'm not going into that.
1225763	You should update (in the English document) the styles TOC 1 through TOC 9 (or whatever the number of levels you actually use) to reflect the indentation that you want. See this question in the Microsoft Community forums.

1195235	Since you have asked for alternative: The less utility could be an alternative for tail -F. It will have to be run as follows: less --follow-name filename.log and press Shift + F. This will give you same results as tail -F.
492301	I have the 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.4 - and for people wanting thier 1st fixed prime I always point them at the 35mm 1.8 1st. Its cheap, light and will work on your D3000.
368990	There is very interesting reading at wikipedia about this topic. For a "standard" game of Klondike (of the form: Draw 3, Re-Deal Infinite, Win 52) the number of solvable games (assuming all cards are known) is between 82-91.5%.
1772773	find / -name "*.iso" which will find (starting in /) all files that end in .iso You may want to add 2>/dev/null if there are many directories you don't have read access to & don't want many permission denied errors amongst the output.
1894655	It all depends on how much data you're transferring, and how fast you want it done :-) if you need to transfer/stream 1gb+ files often (think file servers, streaming media servers, high load SQL databases, etc.) ... then yeah, it's a big difference
2390620	Lots of great answers, but one variable not mentioned is whether you are riding alone or with others. The effects of drafting is significant. I'm at least 2 mph faster riding with others since I can spend much of the time in their wake.

1338379	Passing 1000V at 10A through a diode does not generate 10kW of power. The power dissipated by the diode would be the forward voltage drop times the current. Only the voltage dropped by the diode counts toward power dissipated.
1262548	In I2 you should write this array formula (enter it using Ctrl+Shift+Enter): =INDEX($C$2:$C$9,MATCH(1,($G2=$A$2:$A$9)*(H2=$B$2:$B$9),0)) Then you can copy it to other columns (K, M, O).
2144998	No, it means that the person has a friend request in their account and they have not yet accepted it. If you click on "Cancel", then that will remove the friend request from their account, and Facebook would give you the option to send another friend request.
2185393	Also be aware of brown widows -- like black widows, but you know, brown. Same distinctive round abdomen. Spiky white eggsacs. Around here (San Diego) they are in every dang crevice -- especially empty pots or under the lips of plastic ones.

58194	Consider it a (very) brief form of a construction like this: (You can have one for three dollars, or) two for five. That's just the use that has come to be idiomatic. There's no real reason why one is more popular than the other.
148944	If you are asking for an orthographic -s/-es: there are many examples, e.g. miss, floss, fuss, kiss, ... If it's about a phonetic [(ɪ)s]/[(ɪ)z], there are even moe: e.g. rise, impose; sneeze, snooze, freeze, ...

1631366	Just boot from Windows DVD and do a Startup repair. On most of the systems repeatedly pressing F10 key brings up the boot menu. Give it a try. A hiberated partition cannot be mounted. You have hibernated Windows 8 instead of shutting it down.
376702	Community Chest is named from the original Atlantic City version of Monopoly. In Atlantic City, the Community Chest was a welfare organisation. Therefore, Community Chest cards are more likely than not to give money. On the other hand, Chance cards are more likely to move you to a random 'chance' location.
665957	When you include the squared term, the unsquared term represents the slope when x=0, which is probably not what you want. It is usually better to test sequentially. That is, don't include the squared term in the model when you are assessing the linear component.
1894657	Depends on how many people are using this connection and what they're doing. At its peak, 1gb will obviously be able to handle 10 times as much traffic than 100mb. If you're transferring a lot of data between servers often, then, yes, you will notice a difference.
2134254	In Trello, card titles are single line, i.e. they can't contain a carriage return. (It's similar to the subject line of an email) If you'd like to include multi-line content, you can do that in the card description, or in a comment (using shift + enter)
2141689	If you use an instant messaging client application, such as Trillian, Pidgin, Digsby etc., you can set them up to be able to chat over Facebook too, and those programs have settings that let you play a specific notification sound when a particular friend comes online.
2382958	4 minutes sounds about right. It depends, of course, on how fast you ride and whether you have any delays such as traffic lights or road crossings. For that short a distance, you'll probably spend more time getting ready to ride and locking up your bike at the station restaurant.
916330	When you log off, your session is ended, i.e. any programs you were running and your desktop, etc. and you return to the welcome screen. The PC still on, and there are system-level applications and services running. When you shut down, everything stops running and the PC is powered off.
1893271	It's good stuff, though on a network your size it probably doesn't get you a whole lot. The best thing it does for you is tell you which machines need updates, which going with the standard Windows Update won't. That by itself is a useful view into your network.
2194268	Yes, compost needs water but not too much. It should have the same amount of dampness as a wrung out sponge. And it needs to be tilled and turned over every once in a while to keep it aerated; that will help prevent mildew from forming.
1163136	Explanation : When you use your HDMI Port your graphic card is solicitation much more than normal if the laptop is not cooling properly it could result in extreme overheat. Solution : You need to open your laptop to clean it from dirt and replace it's cooling pate.
1275304	With the current Windows 10 Insider (Fast ring: Windows 10 build 19025.1) you can mount your distro as a network drive. WSL is accessible as wsl$, the path is your distribution name (wsl -l -q). For example net use Z: \\wsl$\Debian /PERSISTENT:YES
949819	It's not the smartest way to share files, but on Ubuntu you can simply use Share Folder option in the context menu, set settings as you wish and thats all. (Relogin may be required.) Then on MAC Ubuntu share should be discoverable.
1645122	At a simple level, dpkg checks to see if dependencies/conflicts are met, extracts the files from the .deb file, runs any {pre,post}{inst,rm} scripts (whichever are applicable), and adds a record that the package is installed into its records (which is just a file, I think).
2283120	Not what you asked, but for safety the most important thing, even more important IMO than getting the right rise and run, is that every step is consistent. Varying as little as 1/4 inch in rise will make even a ballerina fall on her face if she's running up the stairs.
1671768	GShutdown is a utility which allows you to schedule the shutdown or restart of your computer. With it you can simply and quickly choose the turn off time at either a specific time or after a countdown. Install Gshutdown: sudo apt-get install gshutdown source.
2178527	Perhaps not regularly, but certainly whenever the heap begins to look a little dry - successful composting depends on moisture. There is a very good article on composting and moisture level, together with a host of useful links, here, and an excellent one on home composting, by the Royal Horticultural Society, here.
400030	First Watcher is the title of the head citizen of Falme. The title originates from the Watchers over the Waves, and the job of watching for the Return, but over time the people have forgotten about that and just use First Watcher as a title. That's what they're being punished for.
908908	I can't find exactly what SSD that is, but it's a variant of a standard called Mini PCI-E or PCI Express Mini. As detailed here, you need the specific type used by the Eee, of which this is a good example. A guide to upgrading to it can be found here.
1934356	Add an authoritative zone for some.thing.com, and create an A record for @ (windows DNS calls this "(same as parent folder)") pointing to the internal address. Requests for other records under thing.com will be forwarded or recursively looked up, as the server will only be authoritative for the some.thing.com zone.
2228256	My experience with compact stoves for butane/propane mixture: Amazingly efficient when it is warm outside. Super for camping in the summer and early autumn. But in the late autumn, when the temperature starts to creep below 5 deg C: Not so efficient anymore. Alcohol stoves have fallen out of favour in Norway.
27149	I think there is a subtle difference between emphatic and dismissive or terminal. And I think that nope is often used in the latter two ways. Think of how the lips must close together and this gives nope its terminal feeling in a physical way. Pursed lips. Can't pry them open. Not going to change.
52428	I think the context has a lot to do with how the word Nope is perceived: Somebody asks you for something. - Will you do something for me?- Nope. << Rude Somebody asks for information. - Is your name Sam?- Nope. << Playful / informal Maybe the word Nope implies a casual, relaxed attitude, which in some cases may come off as dismissive.
58200	For whatever reason, when using the "X for Y" idiom, the thing that you (as a consumer) gets is usually specified first. I think it's because the longer form of the phrase would be something like "Get (or perhaps 'have') X in exchange for Y". In this case, "get 2 burgers in exchange for 5 dollars".
896888	Run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. You can get it here. You may be able to remove it with that. If not then format and reload is the quickest, easist way to clean out the system. Besides a good reload every now and again keeps the OS running well. Hope that helps.
1051677	I have developed a solution which allows you to have a scrolling desktop on Windows. It's complete freeware and there are multiple ways to enhance your desktop. Infinite_Screen at http://ynea.futureware.at The standard is pressing Ctrl+ (moving mouse to the edges) or CtrlShift+ (mouse move) and four others.
1096154	We repair televisions that have had their HDMI IC's damaged by 'Hot Plugging'. Either the software has been corrupted, or the actual IC damaged, causing the HDMI input not to work. It seems to be a risk as the plug/sockets wear. Best not to take a risk, and switch off before inserting.
908695	The computer restarted for some reason. And when it logged in again Windows detected that your profile was damage and used a temporary profile instead. This can happen, I'm not sure why. But as long as you got the right profile after a reboot there should not be any problem. Maybe someone else has a more detailed explanation.
560285	Double bonds are stronger than single bonds and they are characterized by the sharing of four or six electrons between atoms, respectively. Double bonds are comprised of sigma bonds between hybridized orbitals, and pi bonds between unhybridized p orbitals. Double bonds offer added stability to compounds, and restrict any rotation around the bond axis.
997337	In some contexts, the term "name server" can refer to servers that aren't part of the Internet Domain Name System. For example, a WINS server is a name server for Microsoft's legacy proprietary networking protocols. There may have been other legacy LAN systems that had their own types of name servers that weren't part of Internet DNS.
