2283858	The Stairway Manufacturing Code Association published the International Residential Code (PDF Link) in 2006 which tells you just about everything you could ever want to know about stairs, including: minimum headroom depth (6' 8") minimum tread depth (10") maximum rise (7.75") maximum tread depth variability (3/8") maximum rise variability (3/8") maximum slope of riser (30Â°)
397703	Well, the book does say the crew planned to go back to him in 36 years, which I assume is the time needed for him to age backwards to how old he was when it all began. And he was 61 years old when he had the heart attack, so that would fit if he was 25 years old when it started.
2283124	It not so much about the rise and run lengths specifically ,but about the ratio of the Rise to Run. You should strive to hit a 30-35% ration of rise/run. A 7-11 is the most common and gives you the correct ratio, but any combination of rise to run that hits this 30-35% ratio would be fine.
2372671	Here's an article with average speeds for various different cases. When doing longer than 100km distances, I find it useful to guide by heart rate not speed. Pick a sustainable heart rate and stick to it, regardless of momentary or average speed. In long distances, if it's not racing with tactics and all, it is important to go steady.
1250567	For 3.5 Inch Desktop Hard Drives the power cable and the SATA cable are separate cables. Every recent power supply should come with a few SATA power plugs. If you don't have enough free plugs, or if your power supply is really old, there are adapters. For data you just need a normal SATA cable.
1680933	I had the same issue, yesterday I connected my laptop to the TV and I had to select HDMI Audio output in the Sound Settings menu for having the sound working on TV. This morning I had the HDMI disconnected and the only thing that I had to do for fixing the issue is double clicking in the default audio interface.
1716940	In the output of free, Free memory is the amount of memory which is currently not used for anything. This number should be small, because memory which is not used is simply wasted. Available memory is the amount of memory which is available for allocation to a new process or to existing processes. The example given in the question shows a healthy system.
73546	In the United States, one can go to court to establish a conservatorship for the person. A conservator or guardian is appointed by the court, and acts to protect the person's financial and other interests. The role of a conservator has similarities to the role of the executor of an estate.
88565	The meaning of "from" and "of" are slightly different. We say "made of a substance" (made of rubber). But we say "made from something already made for some other purpose" (made from rubber tires). For example "made of glass", but "made from old Coke bottles". Or "made of paper", but "made from old magazines". These are only general trends in meaning, and not strict rules.
500868	I actually had to do a quick google on "bridge camera" - but I'd say the differences are rather obvious: Bridge Camera = high end point and shoot better optics than a compact camera larger sensor than a compact camera DSLR: bigger sensor exchangeable lenses (key) optical viewfinder where you look through the lens (via a mirror -> SLR = Single Lens Reflex) (key)
1674252	If you want to parse your downloaded HTML files, you can filter them through something like html2text (you have to install the package 'html2text'). This might be helpful if you want to get rid of the formatting in the .html documents, however, parsing the original .html or the new .txt files is pretty much the same thing.
1234798	For me the fix was (right click on Kmplayer) "Main Controls" -> "Audio" -> "Audio Renderer" and set it to "Default Device". I had headphones selected as the device to be used and it only played audio for the first instance and the rest had no sound, but when I set 'Audio Renderer' to 'default device' I had audio for multiple instances again.
1358547	Search for wafer switches. They are rotary switches, which used to be available (update : still are!) as pre-built configurations, or in modular form with up to 12 ways on each wafer and as many wafers as you felt like stacking behind the switch body. A 4-pole 3-way switch is a single wafer, one of the simpler standard configurations.
1266894	Your motherboard only supports "standard" SATA connections - i.e: it doesn't have an mSATA or M.2 socket on it. The Samsung 860 EVO comes in one of three form factors: 2.5" mSATA M.2 As your motherboard doesn't support anything other than "standard" SATA, you should purchase the 2.5" model, and connect it accordingly.
2295954	As a general rule your stairs should be built with this in mind and you won't bust code no matter where you live. 2 risers plus 1 tread must equal a minimum of 24" and a maximum of 25" when added together. Example ( 2 risers of 7-1/4" = 14-1/2" then your tread could be 9-1/2" to 10-1/2").
432767	I just researched this. While I don't know if its true, I have found references that claim that in the comics he ran 13 trillion times the speed of light. For reference, the speed of light converts to 186,282 miles per second. In the TV show, he runs a little over mach 2 which is 0.426261 miles per second (according to google).
1042980	They are different things - The Command Prompt is Not MS-DOS - but as far as the user is concerned they could be the same thing as they do the same things. So it depends on your point of view. From a technical point of view your friend it correct, but from a user perspective you are correct (sort of as there are differences that an expert would spot).
1152285	This could also be caused by your motherboard and/or BIOS configuration. This article explains step-by-step how to check if your motherboard USB "jumpers" are enabled, and how to enable the wake up event in your BIOS. It's specific to an MSI motherboard, but the principle is basically the same no matter what kind of hardware you have.
2380371	You can easily test if your light is too bright. Leave it on your bike and see how it looks. Nowadays there are lots of too bright LED flashlights and headlamps the market that were not designed for cycling. Problem is they flood the light to very wide angle. I would recommend a light made for cycling that has different modes for different use cases.
48873	It's an idiomatic expression that means the same thing as "given this information" or "from this point of view". Example: The young man came from extreme poverty where no one in his family had even graduated high school much less university. In this regard, the fact that he was able to get his PhD. in Mathematics before the age of 22 was nothing short of extraordinary.
2154637	Add something like the following If by "first sheet" you mean one specific sheet no matter the sheets order if(ss1.getSheetName() == 'Sheet1'){ //do something like set date } or If by "first sheet" you mean that the sheets' order matters if(SpreadsheetApp.getSheets()[0].getSheetName() === ss1.getSheetName()){ //do something like set date }
51646	Actually I think "misstep" is probably the best word to use (without additional details about the circumstances). In life we face many decisions, and the choice is to move forward (step) in one direction or another. The wrong choice becomes the "misstep", and the right one could be "a step in the right direction". After many disappointments, they finally took a step in the right direction.
437042	According to the official Marvel power-grid for Spiderman, he is classed as "super-human" (placing him in a category with those able to lift between 800lbs and 25 tons). Although his raw strength is portrayed pretty inconsistently in the comics (including feats of lifting up to 40+ tons), he's usually expected to be able to lift somewhere between 10-20 tons with relative ease.
509137	It's all about the lens. Looking at the cameras which are called a bridge camera, the first thing you will notice is the big honking lens on the thing, I think the rest of the features can be compared with point and shoots but not this one. That's its most distinguishing feature whether or not it makes it compare to an SLR is a matter of opinion.
2056655	You can't. As in the link provided by AgDude: From Nov 5, 2014: Unfortunately there isn't a Cloudwatch Metric for the current IOPS Credit balance like there is with the CPU credits but I am definitely submitting a feature request through to our EBS/Cloudwatch teams for such a metric. Up to now, Nov 2, 2015, this feature was not implemented yet.
2247936	A major second interval consists of 2 semitones (or as you say a whole step) whereas a minor second interval consists of a semitone. Example of major second is C - D. Example of minor second interval is B - C. " considering that in the natural scales formulae, they are both one whole step ?" this is wrong. Of the second intervals only the major second consists of a whole step.
2411979	I am not suggesting you do this, just giving my experience from replacing airbags. I am not familiar with this vehicle specifically, but I have changed the airbag on a couple older cars (early 90's). In the cars I worked on, the airbags were plugged into the car's wiring harness, I could simply unplug them. This will throw the airbag diagnostic light.
269680	Unless your apocalypse took place in a location with antiquated rail technology (like most of the US) that you're re-using, neither steam nor diesel is a good solution. Your (exitsing, rebuilt) locomotives are electric. You can run them with power generated by hydroelectric dams, which should be easier to restore than building an oil refining or wood/coal supply chain. See for instance the railways in Europe.
376623	The Angel's abilities trigger when it enters or leaves the battlefield. Exile, even for just long enough of one instant's effect, counts as leaving the battlefield, and coming back into play counts as entering it. Any cards previously exiled by the Angel would return to your hand, and a new set of three creatures can be chosen for exile. It's all right there, and it all happens right then.
517948	The STM version is better because it has faster, smoother AF, and the front element does not rotate. The optics are also improved which gives you better image quality. The STM focus ring is active during Auto Focus and you can small manual adjustments to focus. This is called Full Time Manual Focus. The STM version also has a much nicer EW-63C lens hood.
678337	If you only have 2 values, just present those 2 values. It doesn't make sense to convert 2 measurements into 2 other quantities (mean and stdev) if your audience is going to argue about the significance of one or the other. If you want to estimate uncertainty, these other responses are right on, but don't forget to add other potential sources of error (measurement instrument bias errors, resolution, etc.).
1010153	Inbound rules filter traffic passing from the network to the local computer based on the filtering conditions specified in the rule. Conversely, outbound rules filter traffic passing from the local computer to the network based on the filtering conditions specified in the rule. Both inbound and outbound rules can be configured to allow or block traffic as needed. These rules are not useful when firewall is off.
2247932	A minor second is a semi tone closer to the root note than a Major Second. D - Eb is a Minor Second. D to E is a Major second. As a general rule of thumb if you have a Major interval and you bring the notes closer to each other by either raising the bottom note or lowering the top note by a semi tone then you have a minor interval.
368989	Solitaire is a game that precedes its computer version, and that means that all the cards are truly shuffled, without the computer peeking in to verify the game is solvable. And like McKay mentioned, with a random shuffle you can definitely end up with an unsolvable game. I'm sure it is possible to design a Solitaire variant in which each game is solvable, though.
471017	In the Cursed Child, it says Draco and Harry look at each other as friends for the first time. He also stands up for Harry and Hermione in the Cursed Child. Letâs also not forget he apologized to Ginny for messing up her kitchen. Finally, Harryâs son and Dracoâs son become best friends. Yeah, Draco definitely turned into a nice person.
1270531	It is just CIDR value. You can learn more in here for CIDR. TL;DR A CIDR network address looks like this under IPv4: 192.30.250.00/18 The "192.30.250.0" is the network address itself and the "18" says that the first 18 bits are the network part of the address, leaving the last 14 bits for specific host addresses. subnet-mask
2116602	In additionally to Andrew anwser AXFR requests can be done with one of the following commands: dig @8.8.8.8 mydomain.com. AXFR nslookup -query=AXFR mydomain.com 8.8.8.8 host -l mydomain.com There are also some brute force scripts (like WS-DNS-BFX) using dictionary to guess other DNS records
2411988	Every vehicle I've worked on has had an airbag fuse you can remove from the fuse panel to fully disable the airbag; the repair manuals recommend pulling this fuse when doing any work in the dash area since there's some risk of triggering the airbags to go off while you're working, which could result in serious injury or at least a significant cost to replace them.
29953	I think there's another nuance in meaning beyond the informal vs formal. For instance: You don't think I'm pretty. If someone responds "no" it is because he is disagreeing with the statement - he actually does think the speaker is pretty. If someone responds "nope" it is because he agrees with the implication - he really does not think the speaker is pretty. It's a subtle difference, but one to note.
900595	Inbound rules allow other system to connect to yours, ex if you would like someone to connect to your windows shares, ftp, web server etc. Outbound rules allow applications on you system to connect to other systems, ex if you want to connect to a web site, IM or some elses ftp. Both the inbound and outbound rules will have no effect if your firewall is off.
958970	I found the answered buried in this post. The new setpci command is sudo setpci -s 00:03.0 0x7b.b=19 btw, this setting isn't "sticky" and won't persist across reboots-- it has to be set upon each boot. You can put this command in a bash script and run it on startup. See here for details on start-up scripts.
1316106	You can place an R ohm resistor (replace R with the characteristic impedance of your trace) in series for each clock fan out, "as close as possible" to the the pin in the fpga (and don't use internal series resistor that some fpgas offer). This way reflections from every node will die upon coming back to the source, and not cause double triggers at the other inputs.
2420144	Presuming it's a standard "trickle" type battery charger and not a "jump pack", I wouldn't advise attempting to start a vehicle with the charger plugged in. The typical result, with a flat battery, is that the vehicle attempts to draw the power required to turn the engine over (the biggest ever demand on a car battery) from the low output charger and overloads the charger.
455864	Spider-Man can lift about 3600 tons, as you can see in this scene in Spider-Man: Homecoming where he holds together a boat. The boat that he held up is actually called "Spirit of America Staten Island Ferry" and it weighs 3600 tons. Tom Holland, the actor who plays him, weighs about 140 pounds. So using these figures, Spider-Man can lift at least a bit more than 48,000 times his own weight.
1014269	Malware. It installs itself everywhere, then prevents you from uninstalling it. Basically this is a trojan. It took me almost an hour of hard work to get rid of it and I am a senior Windows professional. Most of the virus scanners don't react because this actually has some sound editing properties. Anyway, this company should be sued by everyone fooled to install this invasive and abusive piece of software.
1300958	The audio socket (jack) is independent of the USB. The audio jack is connected through the motherboard to the audio output circuitry. USB is connected to the USB bus. Method of approach: Replace the Audio jack or have a local repair person do this. In Device Driver, update all USB Components. After number 2 is complete, run Lenovo System Update and update all drivers that you can. Then run all Windows updates you can.
47464	A helping of food is a single portion of food that is being served to (or that is taken by) someone who is imminently about to eat the food. A portion is an amount of food that is intended to be allotted to one or more people who will be eating at some point in time which could be immediate or in the distant future. All helpings are portions, but not all portions are helpings.
560272	A double bond is composed of a Ï-bond and a Ï-bond. In order to break a bond such as this you must provide the molecule with the energy needed to break the Ï-bond alone plus the one needed to break the Ï-bond alone. In other words, you must provide the sum of those two amounts of energy. Thus, it goes without saying that the sum is a greater number than the two energies alone.
949613	Assuming you want to share on a local network On OS X. Click on System Preferences --> Sharing. Make sure the Services tab is selected. Choose one of the sharing methods, either UNIX sharing or Windows sharing. On your Ubuntu machine, go to Places --> Connect to server and enter the sharing details. Have a look at this forum http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=353584
1014410	NCH has some very useful software, but I'm never using them again. 18 months ago, I put their sound editor on my computer and it ruined Audacity so it wouldn't run unless I opened an existing Audacity project. They install all kinds of little hooks into other software. Beware NCH. As others have said, it's very difficult to impossible to remove NCH software. It's a shame.
1330317	You can start by synthesizing sounds via PWM. This course has several nice lectures on sound effect synthesis via PWM: http://www.youtube.com/course?list=ECD7F7ED1F3505D8D5 The base of the course is an AVR microcontroller, but the topics are about general microcontroller programming. Sound synthesis topic starts at lecture #12.
1295557	You can hold alt to select the file names in block mode. Then copy and paste them to the desired location and then modify all rows at once. It's easier to describe with a gif than with words: Instead of using the mouse, you can also hold shift+alt and then use the arrow keys to select in block mode. You can also use the page up/down keys to quickly select whole columns in larger files.
617325	I have two points to make in answering this question. Point the first First, the z test for difference in proportions of two independent samples is pretty straightforward: The null hypothesis is H$_{0}\text{: }p_{1} - p_{2} = 0$ (i.e. H$_{0}\text{: }p_{1} = p_{2}$), with H$_{\text{A}}\text{: }p_{1} - p_{2} \ne 0$. $z = \frac{\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}}{\sqrt{\hat{p}\left(1-\hat{p}\right)\left[\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \frac{1}{n_{2}}\right]}}$, where: $\hat{p}_{1}$ and $\hat{p}_{1}$ are the sample proportions in group 1 and group 2; $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the sample sizes in group 1 and group 2; and $\hat{p}$ is the estimate of the sample means if H$_{0}$ is true, the best guess of which is simply the overall sample proportion (i.e. of all the data, ignoring which group an observation is from). You might want to consider a continuity correction given that your combined sample size is 102. For example, Hauck and Anderson's (1986) correction gives: $c_{\text{HA}} = \frac{1}{2\min{(n_{1},n_{2})}}$, and a redefined $s_{\hat{p}}$: $s_{\hat{p}}= \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}(1-\hat{p}_{1})}{n_{1}-1} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}(1-\hat{p}_{2})}{n_{2}-1}}$, so that $z = \frac{\left|\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2}\right| - c_{\text{HA}}}{\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}(1-\hat{p}_{1})}{n_{1}-1} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}(1-\hat{p}_{2})}{n_{2}-1}}}$ The appropriate $p$-value for this $z$-statistic is then calculated or looked up in a table, and compared to $\alpha/2$ (two-tailed test). Point the second All differences are "statistically significant" given a large enough sample size. So a good idea is to decide beforehand what the smallest relevant difference in proportions is to you, and then look for evidence of such relevance. You find such evidence by combining the inferences from the test for difference just described, with a test for equivalence. Suppose you decide beforehand that a meaningful difference in proportion for your purposes is on that is at least 0.05 (i.e. $|p_{1} - p_{2}| \ge 0.05$), then the corresponding test for equivalence of proportions for two independent groups is: H$^{\text{-}}_{0}\text{: }|p_{1} - p_{2}| \ge 0.05$, which translates into two one-sided null hypotheses: H$^{\text{-}}_{01}\text{: }p_{1} - p_{2} \ge 0.05$ H$^{\text{-}}_{02}\text{: }p_{1} - p_{2} \le -0.05$ These two one-sided null hypotheses can be tested with: $z_{1} = \frac{0.05 - \left(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\hat{p}\left(1-\hat{p}\right)\left[\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \frac{1}{n_{2}}\right]}}$, and $z_{2} = \frac{\left(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\right)+0.05}{\sqrt{\hat{p}\left(1-\hat{p}\right)\left[\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \frac{1}{n_{2}}\right]}}$. With a continuity correction $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ instead become: $z_{1} = \frac{0.05 - \left(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\right) + c_{\text{HA}}}{\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}(1-\hat{p}_{1})}{n_{1}-1} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}(1-\hat{p}_{2})}{n_{2}-1}}}$, and $z_{2} = \frac{\left(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\right)+0.05-c_{\text{HA}}}{\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}(1-\hat{p}_{1})}{n_{1}-1} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}(1-\hat{p}_{2})}{n_{2}-1}}}$. If you reject both H$^{\text{-}}_{01}$ and H$^{\text{-}}_{02}$ (both tested at $\alpha$, not $\alpha/2$, and both tested with right tail rejection regions), then you can conclude that you have evidence of equivalence. Finally... if you combine inference from tests of H$_{0}$ and H$^{\text{-}}_{0}$ (i.e. test for difference and test for equivalence), then you get one of the following possibilities: reject H$_{0}$ and reject H$^{\text{-}}_{0}$: conclude trivial difference between proportions (i.e. yes there is a difference, but it's too small for you to care about); reject H$_{0}$ and not reject H$^{\text{-}}_{0}$: conclude relevant difference between proportions (i.e. larger than 0.05); not reject H$_{0}$ and reject H$^{\text{-}}_{0}$: conclude equivalence of proportions; or not reject H$_{0}$ and not reject H$^{\text{-}}_{0}$: conclude indeterminate (i.e. underpowered tests).

1401674	Firstly, it's VA, not 'va'. 50 VA means that it can supply 50 volt-amps. At 24 V secondary that means it can supply a little over 2 A. (2 A x 24 V = 48 VA.) Primary current will ideally be given by \$ I = \frac {VA}{V} = \frac {50}{480} = 0.104~A \$. Due to losses in the transformer the primary current will be, maybe, 10 to 20% higher than that at full load.
1863168	It's a handy general purpose boot option for troubleshooting older OS's. As others have said the addition of IDE Disk support with ESX 4 removes some of the usefulness but it certainly had its place - I've got a couple of really small appliances that boot from floppy images. I agree that it shouldn't be included by default - it's wasteful and of no use whatsoever on most VM's.
2098030	Most often when I see this kind of DHCP-not-updating DNS behavior, it is because the credentials that DHCP uses to do the updates have a problem. To access the credentials screen - Open up DHCP, right click IPv4 protocol, select the "Advanced Tab", and then the "Credentials" button. You should also make sure that the "Dynamically update DNS A and Ptr ..." option is checked on the DNS tab.
2349869	That's fine, they are nominally the same. 120v is utility supply defined by ANSI C84.1. 115v is point of use desired voltage, generally specified by NEMA. One is 120v +5/-10% tolerance, the other is 115V +/-10%. NEMA 5-15 is a standard receptacle used throughout a US home. This document says the cabinet draws 2.0 amps, should easily be used on any nearly any circuit.
1044690	Short answer, no a CPU will not get slower with age. Slightly longer answer: A CPU will work so long as all of the connections and transistors are working properly. While in a normal wire there might be movement that can make the connection intermittent, that is not the case on the CPU as: the circuits are etched into the silicon things are much smaller If something does break, anything can happen: from bad math to the computer not starting up.
1250568	You've noted that the HD is SATA, so you will need a SATA cable between the motherboard and the drive, and a SATA power cable from the power supply to the drive. https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B85M-G43/Specification shows that the motherboard has two SATA ports. Perhaps you have one motherboard SATA port used up by an optical drive - you can temporarily use it for this project.
1401675	It is voltampere, the unit for indicating apparent power. VA = Vac x Iac 50 = 24 x ? Iac = 2,083 A Real power is indicated by watt (W). This is in electrical terms the real power that can be supplied by the device. The real power is less than the apparent power and is the part that actually does any work and dissipates heat. So the current available to you is less than Iac.
2086380	Edit: It seems my approach works only temporarily. Thanks to @hamx0r for posting a screenshot of how to apply the long-term fix. Disable storing docker credentials on mac os x keychain by removing this entry from your ~/.docker/config.json file. "credsStore": "osxkeychain", In my case, I had no additional configuration (I wasn't logged in), so I just blanked the entire file.
545656	The anode is the electrode at which the oxidation half-reaction takes place. In a galvanic cell, the reaction is spontaneous, there is no external potential applied, and when the anode material is oxidized that makes the anode the negative electrode. In an electrolytic cell, it is the external potential that drives the reaction, the anode is the electrode where the oxidation reaction happens, consequently this time it is the electrode with the positive potential.
843937	In Gradient Descent or Batch Gradient Descent, we use the whole training data per epoch whereas, in Stochastic Gradient Descent, we use only single training example per epoch and Mini-batch Gradient Descent lies in between of these two extremes, in which we can use a mini-batch(small portion) of training data per epoch, thumb rule for selecting the size of mini-batch is in power of 2 like 32, 64, 128 etc. For more details: cs231n lecture notes

938402	For #1 - depends on your ISP, as others have said. However, if you set up an account with DynDNS you can get your mac (or often your router) to update its DNS entry with the latest IP address as it changes. To be honest, I'd be more concerned about whether your ISP will let you access your server than whether the IP address is static (although one will often tell you about their attitude to the other).
2104865	No. A MX record only determines which mail server mail to a user at that domain/subdomain should be ultimately delivered to. Without an MX record, it will attempt to deliver to the actual hostname in the email address, so keeping @MichaelHampton 's comment to your answer in mind you'll still need to be able to receive bounces, etc. but as long as you accept mail (even if routing to /dev/null) you should be OK on that end.
2411987	It is possible to remove an airbag. This is not recommended by any vehicle safety standard. In the event that an airbag is to be removed for an "SRS" light diagnoses, there are "SRS" dummy resisters available. There are different resistance values available. You would have to consult your manufacturer for details. NOTICE: There are very specific procedures for removing and disposing of pyrotechnics. Consult your local vehicle manufacturer for details.
1039353	According to the HDMI specification, yes it's hot-pluggable. It supports "HPD" (Hot Plug Detect Signal). The HPD (Hot-Plug-Detect) feature is a communication mechanism between a source and a sink device that makes the source device aware that it has been connected/disconnected to/from the sink device.

559295	Not all of QM program use adirect keyword of functional. Some of them you've to mix an ingredient of % functional, says in NWCHem. In that, you aint use keyword 'cam-b3lyp' directly, you need the combination of keywords like xc xcamb88 1.00 lyp 0.81 vwn_5 0.19 hfexch 1.00 cam 0.33 cam_alpha 0.19 cam_beta 0.46
809391	I'd say your problem is that you are imagining the light rays emanating out from the center of the star. Try it again with light emanating from each square area on the surface, and you will see that being at the same temperature means each square on the surface sends out the same number of rays, but there are just more such squares. Then you will see a lot more light rays coming from the larger star, in proportion to its surface area.

2247944	You wrote: considering that in the natural scales formulae, they are both one whole step This is the crux of your question. M2 and m2 (major 2nd and minor 2nd) intervals are not both whole steps. Only the M2 is a whole step. The m2 is a half step. Nonetheless, in the diatonic scale, each can represent a step. Step-wise motion includes m2s and M2s, and also even m3s in most textbooks. So they represent steps, but just not necessarily whole steps.
1245101	Another thing that may significantly reduce the Size on Disk value are situations where a file is not actually stored on disk but is still accessible through various means. For example, the Offline Files feature of OneDrive enables a user to store a file in such a way that it is accessible via an internet connection. The file still exists on disk and has a certain size, but because it is not on disk until it is downloaded, it takes up no space. Example on a folder inside...
1390082	Set \$ t = \tau \$ in your equation. This gives $$ y(\tau) = Ku(\tau)(1-e^{- \frac {\tau}{\tau}}) = Ku (1 - e^{-1}) = Ku(1 - 0.368) = 0.632Ku $$ where K is the DC gain, u(t) is the input signal, t is time, \$ \tau \$ is the time constant and y(t) is the output. The time constant can be found where the curve is 63% of the way to the steady state output. Easy-to-remember points are \$ \tau \$ @ 63%, \$ 3 \tau \$ @ 95\% and \$ 5 \tau \$ @ 99\%. Your calculation for \$ \tau = \frac {3}{5} \$ appears to be based on the time the curve reaches \$ 5 \tau \$ but that is very difficult to pinpoint on the gentle slope of the curve. In the graphical solution below it looks more like 0.5 s rather than 0.6 s. (\$ 3 \cdot 63\% = 1.89 \$.) Full answer \$ \tau \$ = 0.5.
119	This makes sense only if the one giving you the good wishes is in the same situation as yourself. For instance, if someone wishes you a Happy Birthday, it's nonsensical to say 'You too!' unless they happen to share the same birth date. If someone wishes you 'Merry Christmas', it's a reasonable assumption that they are Christian, or that they do at least recognize and celebrate the Christmas holiday, so it's fine to respond with 'you too', or more properly, "Merry Christmas to you too!"
14039	In my opinion Nope is a dismissive and slightly rude version of no. Nope should never be used in a professional context e.g. it should never be used as an option for web site or search engine users to select as a response to a question, because it makes the company using it look un-professional and rude to their customers. The use of the word nope by Google and others makes me cringe so much that I will never click on it in response to a question.
2040241	I may have answered my own question, at least partially. Apparently the FCC operates a site called the National Broadband Map which allows you to get a rough gauge of ISPs and their advertised bandwidth to an address. The output looks like this: Of course, it would be better to know their actual physical plant (OC3 lines etc), but this is a good start. Note that this is "advertised" bandwidth, so it is essentially "brochure" information, not really their true capacity on the block or building.
476394	Another trip to the Hollywood Acid page on TV Tropes has finally revealed the answer. It Lives! It Grows! It Destroys! is season 1, episode 8 of The Incredible Hulk, an animated TV show from the 1980s. A rival scientist has created a yellow slime that dissolves everything it touches, which of course immediately escapes. The hulk defeats it and all is well. The final scene in the above video is the one I have the vivid memory of, and it did indeed turn out to be mustard.
2411980	It all varies on a car by car basis, some cars have wires you can disconnect under the seats/pedals and some you have to take the housing that encloses the wires inside the steering wheel column off. Would also be worth mentioning that disabling your airbags is classed as a modification and if you had a crash and your insurers looked into why your airbags didn't go off and discovered you disabled them then your insurance would be null and void
45059	'ensure' - to make certain that (something) shall occur or be the case - needs a direct object in order to make sense. In other words, we need to state what the 'something' is. 'make sure' on the other hand, means to confirm, or establish that something is definitely so. And its usage implies that we've already established what the 'something' is, earlier in the conversation. Person A: The keys are not in the car. Do not bother looking there. Person B: I just want to make sure (that the keys are not in the car).
7331	Any one of the suggested phrases above sound good to me (British), including your original offerings. They don't come much simpler than that, except maybe: I'm just leaving/I've just finished Since your family undoubtedly know what you have just finished (or where you're leaving from). I'd simply like to add a few more alternatives to the list. I've just clocked off. I've just punched out. I've just got out of work I've just knocked off. Just left. Get a beer out and the dinner on.
58201	You seem to understand most of the implications, but the verb you are adding to the front leads to a different meaning than what was intended. Specifically, you expand "2 for 5" as Pay 2 dollars for 5 hamburgers However, the intended meaning of the phrase is Buy 2 hamburgers for 5 dollars When "X for Y" is used to describe a sale or deal that I've seen in the US, the meaning is "Get X in exchange for Y" in some fashion, with X being what you get not what you give.
93528	'Nope' is a variant of 'no' (exclamation). First known use: 1888 (M-W) Phonologically, pronunciation can explain where the P came from. Suppose someone asked you a question and you said 'No'. You'd usually pause after saying 'No' (exclamation) with your lips already positioned to articulate a P, that's why most people articulate a P. That's called excrescent P. (Sometimes producing a little puff of air is for emphasising 'no' while leaving it unreleased indicates lazy and sloppy speech.)
249689	You would basically need to be a medic as well as a torturer to maximise the torturing. Using Drugs like ephedrine and amphetamines to keep them awake whilst also superficially healing their wounds for more torture later, including keeping a defibrillator at hand if necessary. There is a vast number of stimulates that could be used with their own side effects to help with the torturing but I believe Amphetamine or ephedrine will be the best options.
432765	Strictly from the TV show up to the point of Legends of Today, Caitlin Snow mentions his top speed quite accurately: What's the fastest Barry's run? Little over Mach two, when he ran back in time. Taking Googles conversion that's just over 2469.6km/h or 1534.54mp/h Mach 2 = 2469.6km/h and Mach 2.5 = 3087km/h. I'd say this is our top speed range, I'd assume over 2.5 would be more than a little over Mach 2.
2366498	The most fixie-specific bits are the hub, cog, and lock ring. I know it's supposed to be one part per post, but these really go together. You can't use a regular-old free-wheel hub for your fixie (at least without some modifications). You'll need a fixed-specific hub which has threads for a lock ring, and a cog to match. The lock ring is what keeps the cog from loosening when you use the drive train to stop. Surly offers each of these parts.
101	As an American English speaker, I would have no trouble interpreting a reply of "you too!" if I told someone "good luck!" It functions the same as "same to you". When it comes to a holiday greeting, though, I have more often seen it where people add the "you too" to the original greeting. For example: Person A : Merry Christmas! Person B: Thanks, merry Christmas to you, too! If you'd prefer a simple rule, then "you too!" is acceptable on its own but it might make more sense when it's paired with the original greeting.
588573	For a given dataset, increasing the confidence level of a confidence interval will only result in larger intervals (or at least not smaller). That's not about accuracy or precision but rather about how much risk you're willing to take about missing the true value. If you're comparing confidence intervals for the same sort of parameter from multiple data sets and one is smaller than the other, you could say that the smaller one is more precise. I prefer to talk about precision rather than accuracy in this situation (see this relevant Wikipedia article).
2247982	In music theory "Whole step" has a special meaning. The distance from one note on the piano keyboard to the next highest (whether it be a black note, C to C# or a white one, E to F) is called a "Half Step". Two half steps make a "Whole step". In British English we say "semitone" and "tone". A major scale goes Whole step, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half. (I hope I got that right!). So don't call the distance between EACH note of a scale a "Whole step", you'll just confuse yourself!
532779	Gear preferences are really a matter of individual aims and taste. What is for one person a 'noticeable improvement', might not at all address what you hope to improve in your panoramas. I suspect this is why one is discouraged from asking shopping questions. The best option is to go to a brick-and-mortar store that sells the equipment and try it out either in the showroom or by renting the equipment you are thinking about and give it a whirl 'in the field' to see if it suits your needs. Enjoy!
1316949	Because not all the capacitors have a polarity. As far as I know, only electrolytic capacitors have a fixed polarity, while for instance ceramic capacitors don't. If you look at the schematics, you will see that (in proper designs) electrolytic, or in general capacitors with a polarization, have the negative shield curved and a plus sign in the positive shield; the other capacitors are symmetric, so you cannot say which is the direction if not by the label.
1388596	First, I think you got the principle of hall sensors wrong. A hall sensor is a rectangular, thin piece of a conductor, through which a current is drawn from one side to the other: | --------+--------- | | | current | -----+ ------> +------ | | | | --------+--------- | A magnetic field perpendicular to the screen plane causes a force on the moving electrons, either upwards or downwards. This causes a voltage between the upper and lower terminal of the sensor, which should be measured with high impedance. The voltage depends on the material and (linearly!) on the current and the magnetic field. So a hall sensor is a pure magnetic field sensor, but of course you can use it to measure the field of a second current, and so measure this current. There are many ICs available which do exactly this. What you described in your first paragraph sounds more like a transformer, which can also be used to measure currents. But as they rely on induction, they only work for AC, while hall sensors can be used for DC, too. This is also the reason why your idea about a second trace parallel to the trace to be measured does not work. You DO need a hall effect current sensing sensor. There are many different types of these sensors, but in most cases, the current has to flow through them. However, there are some ICs which are just placed over a trace, i.e. the current does not flow through the sensor, only through the trace beneath it. For example this type from Melexis:
111298	In fact, owl eyes refers to a drunk man whom Nick meets in Gatsby's library. He was in the library because he wants to discover the truth about Gatsby while other guests are very busy with silly rumors about Gatsby. Actually, he takes one of the books from the shelf, but he is shocked because they seem real , but at the same time they are new. That is mean no one read and touch them even Gatsby himself, so Gatsby used them for just showing his huge wealth.
1279149	What you are seeing is only the data size and not the size on the disk. Data is allocated on the disk in units that depend on how the disk was formatted. Most common sizes are 4K (4096) or 512. The space after the data and up to the end of the last allocation unit is simply wasted. So your professor is right: Concentrating the data in one file will reduce wasted space, unless the data of the file is exactly a multiple of the allocation unit (which only happens very rarely unless planned for).
1048707	Use Enter ~ . to exit a frozen SSH connection, then just start a new one in its place. Alternatively, run pkill ssh from a new terminal, to kill all SSH connections. Better yet, try mosh, which is designed to remain connected even after connection loss or even network reconfiguration. (The Reset menu item is not going to work, because it only resets the terminal window's state [similar to turning a monitor off and on again], but it does not know anything about what is actually running in that terminal window.)
370104	However, if you started a list and enumerated the initial conditions -- I feel like I've seen this on a linux version of Solitare: the numbering of deck order, that is -- and you definitively decide a certain one is un-winnable, you then could compare notes across nodes (share with friends) and VOILA: a list of un-winnable starting deck stacks. I've been starting to think the Windows 7 version has the un-winnable decks removed, ... I don't know, it's a little heavy-handed and smug about the statistics.
2030715	What you are asking for is possible. However, do to the lack of a starttls/stls command in http, it is only available to https. Non-certificate ssh-keys will not work for this purpose. A client will need their certificate (and private key) installed in their browser. The sever will need to include the following directives in addition to other standard ones for a https listener. SSLVerifyClient require SSLVerifyDepth 1 SSLCACertificateFile path/to/a/trusted/CA.crt
2235848	An ideal music for reading would be tailored to the particular book. With the development of tablets and eBook readers, one could imagine as a new composing discipline the creation of a B.O.S. (Book's original soundtrack) which would be programmed to adapt itself to the reader's speed. Some readers are able to generate incidental music in their head that follows their reading and may perhaps help them follow what they are doing. A more specific question would be : can we use music to help people learning to read or having a form of dyslexia?
13445	Native English speakers often colloquially use "up" to mean "located north" and "down" to mean "located south". If my friend was going to school in the north I would say she was "up at school", if her school was south I might say "down at school". I might not even really know where the school is and still say "up" just because it makes the sentence flow better. In this sentence it essentially has no meaning; you could understand it to mean exactly the same thing as: "Does she seem happy at school?" (You can say "over" to mean "located east" or "west".)
58207	In English, it is idiomatic for the price to be second. Consider: Buy 2 for the price of 1 ...is often abbreviated as... 2 for 1 ...and, conventionally, most shorthand deals will follow that pattern. The 'buy' prefix can be assumed and the 'for' can always be inferred to be shorthand for 'for the price of'. As to why it is this way, I don't believe there is any strong reason for it past arbitrary convention. Doing it the other way against the current consistency would cause confusion and quickly be corrected for being misleading.
