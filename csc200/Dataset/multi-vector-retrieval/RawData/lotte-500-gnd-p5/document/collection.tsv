867174	There is a related fallacy of "defining into existence" when implicitly defined entities are illicitly declared existent, versions of the ontological argument are often accused of defining God into existence. Kant clearly expressed the issue in his thesis that "existence is not a predicate". Even for ideal objects in mathematics it must be proved from axioms that objects fulfilling the defining conditions exists, the object is then said to be "well-defined". For example, Euclid defines equilateral triangle as a triangle with equal sides, but he gives a straightedge and compass construction of it before using it in demonstrations (in modern texts the two steps are often combined into a single "theorem-definition"). But in itself giving contradictory definitions with non-existent referents, and reasoning about them, is not a fallacy, although it does pose an old philosophical puzzle. Quine in On What There Is gave it a nickname that stuck:"Nonbeing must in some sense be, otherwise what is it that there is not? This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's beard". Plato mused over the nature of fleeting "sensibles", and famously assigned to them less than being, the becoming. This was a major point of difference between him and Aristotle, who saw becoming as a form of being, and argued against its dismissal by Parmenides and Plato. But objects nonexistent due to inconsistency, like round squares, pose the same logical problem: if round square is not what is it that there is not? One solution is due to Meinong: objects in logic may not exist but only "subsist", this is Meinong's version of becoming, but it also covers all sorts of fictions and absurdities. If you take this route you have to give up existential generalization, P(a) does not imply existence of x with property P, and allow contradictory sentences, P(a) and ¬P(a) may both hold if a is non-existent. If you give an argument with subsistent objects in the premises you may conclude all sorts of things about them, but it will not get you very much since none of them have to exist. To move from subsistence to existence would be exactly to commit the "defining into existence" fallacy. A more mainstream version of dealing with Plato's beard, one favored by Quine himself, is due to Russell. It involves eliminating defined objects from premises by using descriptions, before any logical analysis of arguments. Russell's way of talking about say round squares is to use a variable x with predicates R(x) and S(x), rather than a proper name with dubious existential status. The rest depends on how exactly you want to use round squares in premises. If you want to make any existential claim about them, e.g. "some round squares are green" ∃x(R(x)∧S(x)∧G(x)), then any premise involving it will come out as false, and any argument based on it will be unsound, even if valid. But something like "all round squares are round" ∀x(R(x)∧S(x) → R(x)) is not just true but even a logical tautology. For that matter, even "all round squares are green" ∀x(R(x)∧S(x) → G(x)) is a tautology, if we are assuming that R and S contradict each other. Plato's beard has an interesting application in mathematics. In proofs by contradiction negation of the intended conclusion is treated as an additional premise, and an auxiliary valid, but unsound argument is given using it. The contradiction in the conclusion of the auxiliary argument is then interpreted as entailing the intended conclusion. But at the onset of the auxiliary argument we do invoke inconsistent objects, implicitly or explicitly. For instance, Euclid's proof of the irrationality of square root of 2 ostensibly involves defining a rational number with square 2, and then reasoning about it. This non-existent number can be interpreted in Meinongian or in Russellian manner. See more in SEP's Nonexistent Objects, and Negative Existential Beliefs.
995712	chkdsk /r does the same thing as chkdsk /f only it also checks for bad sectors on the disk and recovers any readable information. Running chkdsk /r implies that also chkdsk /f is run. chkdsk /f only checks for disk errors, not bad sectors. Microsoft has a detailed page for chkdsk. The following is a snippet explaining /f and /r parameters. Fixing disk errors: Chkdsk corrects disk errors only if you specify the /f command-line option. Chkdsk must be able to lock the drive to correct errors. Because repairs usually change a disk's file allocation table and sometimes cause a loss of data, chkdsk sends a confirmation message. Finding physical disk errors: Use the /r command-line option to find physical disk errors in the file system.
997300	There is no such thing as a Domain Name Server. DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is simply a hierarchy of Name Servers that has the intent to translate host names into IP addresses on a global scale. A name server hosts or caches these translations, in the case where they are hosted the name server is often called a DNS Server. Counting all name servers is a bit tricky, because you can't simply enumerate all the domains. Let me give you an example on resolving superuser.com in a non-cached way: The name server that I use is 192.168.1.1. This is my local router which caches DNS entries, it has a Hosts file to reroute malicious domains. The router has the name servers 8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8 set, known as Google DNS, they also cache. Google DNS will contact authoritative root name servers, which are the top of the DNS hierarchy. Google DNS will contact the .com name servers, the IP of which it received from the ARNs. Google DNS will contact the DNS server for superuser.com, of which IP it received from .com. A simply whois reveals: NS1.SERVERFAULT.COM NS2.SERVERFAULT.COM NS3.SERVERFAULT.COM The IPs for these name servers are known as they are registered at the .com name server, when you register a new domain you always have to fill in the DNS servers that you use along their IP. Google DNS will contact the DNS servers of superuser.com to find the IP of superuser.com: nslookup superuser.com NS1.SERVERFAULT.COM Server: NS1.SERVERFAULT.COM Address: 64.34.119.33 Name: superuser.com Address: 64.34.119.12 I would suggest you to read through Domain Name System and Name Servers for more details. The term name servers are also used in different contexts, read Spiff's answer for more.
1165311	Before I begin answering the question, think about this: if DualShock uses Bluetooth, then how does the PlayStation establish a connection to all 4 controllers with a single radio? I use Scarlet.Crush's SCP drivers, and they seem to have great Bluetooth support (I use regular USB). They require sacrificing one Bluetooth dongle to install SCP drivers on it, which replace the original Bluetooth drivers/stack (meaning the dongle will be dedicated to connecting DualShock controllers and nothing more). The fact that plural in "controllers" is used frequently in the documentation confirms that you are able to connect all four controllers into a single dongle. Due to the controller's hardware limitations (4 lights) and SCP's own limitations as a result, you can only have up to four controllers connected at once. Since a concurrent connection to 4 devices are supported by a majority of Bluetooth radios (the forum post above lists them out) and this does not even come near to the spec's hard limit of 7, there is no doubt you will be able to connect all 4 controllers with a single dongle, regardless of whether they are DS3 or DS4, given that everything is correctly configured and paired up.
2217110	Natural vs synthetic I did a bit of research into this and found that there are two main kinds of paintbrush bristles: natural (usually made from animal hair) and synthetic (usually made from some combination of nylon and polyester). Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages according to what kind of paint you're using. The TL;DR is that natural bristles are better for oil-based paint while synthetic bristles are better for water-based or latex paint. For more details, see this page. As a bonus, it also gives some information on the shape as well as the material of paintbrush bristles: Bristle Shape: Most paintbrushes available today are square-cut brushes. They're perfect for holding and laying paint onto virtually any surface. However, square-cut brushes don't provide as much control when painting into corners, up to adjacent surfaces, or along narrow edges or surfaces. For more precise control, use a sash brush, which has its bristles cut at a slight angle. Sash brushes are particularly well-suited for cutting in around the perimeter of a room. Bristle Tips: Better quality brushes have bristles with flagged, or split, ends. Flagged bristles hold more paint and spread paint more smoothly. Some brushes, especially sash brushes, have tipped ends, which should not be confused with flagged ends. Tipped brushes come to a point; they're not cut flat and straight, as is a standard brush. Professional painters favor tipped brushes because they provide greater control and allow you to apply paint more precisely. More details on different types This list goes into more detail on the usages of synthetic and various types of natural bristles, although it doesn't distinguish between different types of synthetic material: Badger For blending oil paint on canvas, Badger Hair is an age-old tradtion. It comes from various parts of the world and is more readily available than most animal hair, although the quality varies greatly. Badger hair is thickest at the point, and relatively thin at the root, so it has a distinctive "bushy" appearance. MEDIA: oil Camel Hair Camel Hair does not come from camels at all. It is found in watercolor and lettering brushes and usually is made of squirrel, goat, ox, pony or a blend of several hairs, depending on the desired softness and intended cost of the brush. MEDIA: lettering, tempera, watercolor Hog Bristle Hog Bristle is obtained from hogs in several parts of the world, the most sought after coming from China. Bristle is unlike any other natural filler in that it forms a V-shaped split or "flag" at the tip and tends to have a natural curve. A brush with "interlocked" bristles, with the curves formed inward to the ferrule, has a natural resistance to fraying and spreads medium to thick paints smoothly and evenly. A selection of pure hog bristle brushes is recommended for oil and acrylic painting, and is a far less expensive alternative to good-quality softer hairs. MEDIA: acrylic, oil Kevrin/Mongoose Hair Kevrin/Mongoose Hair is strong, resilient, and makes a good long-wearing, medium to professional quality brush for oil and acrylic painting. MEDIA: acrylic, oil Kolinsky Sable Kolinsky Sable is not really from a sable at all, but comes from the tail of a species of mink that is a member of the weasel family found in Siberia and northeastern China. It is generally conceded to be the best material for oil and watercolor brushes due to its strength, spring and ability to retain its shape ("snap"). It holds a very fine point or edge. This is considered a professional grade of hair, and if properly cared for, Kolinsky will last for many years. MEDIA, oil, watercolor Ox Hair The best quality comes from the ears of cattle or oxen. The Ox Hair has a very strong body with silken texture, is very resilient, has good "snap", but lacks a fine tip. Therefore, it is most useful in medium gradewash brushes, or flat shaped brushes. Frequently, ox hair is blended with other natural hair to increase the resiliency of a brush. MEDIA: lettering, watercolor Pony Hair Pony Hair is soft but strong, from mature animals at least 2 years of age. It is primarily used for scholastic grade brushes, but often blended with other hairs for inexpensive watercolor and touch-up brushes. MEDIA: acrylic, scholastic, tempera, watercolor Red Sable Red Sable is obtained from any member of the weasel family with "red" hair, not at all from the animal known as the sable. It is found in a variety of brush styles for many varied mediums, with quality and characteristics varying greatly. A good quality pure Red Sable is a good alternative to the more expensive Kolinsky, with similar performance and durability. Often, weasel hair is blended with ox hair to make a more economical brush, but the fine point is sacrificed. MEDIA: oil, watercolor Sabeline Sabeline is actually select, light-colored ox hair dyed to resembled red sable. Lettering and watercolor brushes often use Sabeline mixed with Sable to lower the cost of a brush. MEDIA: lettering, watercolor Squirrel Gray Squirrel (Talayoutky), most highly in demand for lettering brushes and quills, is native to Russia and nearly always fell in short supply. Brown squirrel (Kazan) is more readily available, and is used mainly for medium quality and scholastic watercolor brushes. A very fine, thin hair, taken from squirrel tails, it points as well as Kolinsky, but has very little "snap" because the hair is not very resilient. It works best with liquid paints and inks. MEDIA: lettering, watercolor Synthetic Synthetics are man-made of either nylon or polyester filaments. They can be tapered, tipped, flagged, abraded or etched to increase color carrying ability. Often, synthetic filaments are dyed and baked to make them softer and more absorbent. The common name for this filament is "Taklon". Advantages of synthetic brushes are: 1) They are less prone to damage from solvents, insects or paints. 2) They are easier to keep clean than animal hair brushes because the filaments don't have animal scale structures to trap paint. 3) They are less prone to breakage and are durable on many different surfaces. 4) They are better suited for painting with acrylics because a synthetic filament will withstand the caustic nature of acrylic paints with less damage. MEDIA: all Finally, this list goes into even greater detail on a huge variety of types of bristle, falling into four main families: animal hair, vegetable fibre, synthetic, and wire brush. Within each of these families, several different materials are described and compared. It's too long to copy it all here, but should be useful as further reading if the above isn't detailed enough.
2259929	A good way of thinking about it is as a clockwork watch or clockwork mechanism or machine. You could have two watches keeping the same time but with different time signatures. Think of the second hand as the pulse with its tick, tock, tick, tock and the beat as the mechanism driving the second hand as 123, 123, 123, 123. Each tick or tock is supported by three beats. A beat behind the second hand pulse of 1234, 1234, 1234, 1234 would be a 16/4 time signature. A beat that is the same as the pulse 1234, 1234, e.t.c. would be in common time. An old mantelpiece clock could be imagined in cut time 2/2. That's why trying to determine the time signature of a tune by counting foot taps as beats only works in 4/4 or if you double or half your tap interval to an 8/4 or 2/4, e.t.c. Complex time signatures can't be determined that way. For example, if you tap out a 6/8 jig, you'd fool yourself into thinking it's in 2/8 time, i.e. two beats to every bar whereas you are actually tapping out groups of three beats, 123, 123. A common question in traditional music that might help is the difference between a jig and a reel. To real (forgive the pun) traditional musicians, who have learned by ear and never seen a musical score, the reply will be something using words; if you can say 'jiggery, jiggery,' to the music, it's a jig and if you can say 'this is how a reel goes, this is how a reel goes,' it's a reel. The jiggery is Ji Ge Ry, 123, beat on the capital letter, and this is how a reel goes is Thisis Howa Reel Goes, 1234. Therefore, a jig is in 6/8 time (usually) 123, 123, i.e. 6 X 8th notes (beats) per bar and a reel is in 4/4 time 4 X 4 notes (beats) per bar. To understand the 123 grouping think of a waltz which is often (usually in 3/4 time, i.e. three quarter notes per bar. You'll find yourself saying 123, 123, 123, 123 while tapping out the pulse as one tap on the 1 of each 123 grouping.
2380373	Blinding road users will be the result of the following factors: Total light output Mirror design (how is the light shaped) How you aimed your light Most trail lights (and high output battery powered lights) use a mirror that casts the light in a symmetrical shape. This means light is cast up, down, left and right. Light cast above the horizon is what binds other road users. Light above the horizon is however great for trail riding as it lets you see overhanging branches and other impediments. Car running lights (i.e. not high beams) are designed with a horizontal cut-off, where light does not shine above the horizon (actually a low percentage does, this called spill light). If the car light is aimed correctly, the the horizontal cut-off falls below oncoming road users line of vision. This is why you are typically not horribly blinded by oncoming cars, if they are a) using their running lights and b) have their lights aimed correctly. High beams do not have a horizontal cut-off, which is the primary reason you get blinded so badly. Some bike lights (those that are approved for German roads) will have a mirror that has this sharp horizontal cut-off. They usually will usually be indicated by the some statement on StVZO compliance. Most dynamo lights (e.g., B & M, Schmidt, etc) will have this mirror design. There are also a few battery powered lights (e.g., some B & M models), but they are few and far between. If you have a light with a symmetrical beam, you can lessen the blinding effect by pointing the light down (as suggested in @Batman's answer), however due to the symmetrical nature of the beam you will still blind road users more than if you had a light with a horizontal cutoff and was aimed correctly as there will still be more spill light above the horizon. This effect is also confounded by how narrowly or wide the symmetrical beam is focused. Wide flood lights will almost always blind, despite how much you aim them down, spot lights will blind less when pointed down. Finally, total output does have some impact too, but it is also confounded with mirror design (e.g., high output with a horizontal cut-off may blind less than a low output symmetrical beam). What really determines whether or not you blind other users is the total amount of light shining above the horizon at their eyes. In your case your 750 lumen lights are likely trail lights with a wide symmetrical beam. If you run them at full output you will likely blind others unless you severely aim it downwards.
2382077	I just tried using a sackbarrow as a trailer, and it was workable, but not recommended. That's a "trailgator" kids bike comealong joiner. The clamp that goes on the kid's bike's head tube is bolted to the handle of the barrow, the eagle-eyed will notice a spare crank arm used as packing for this test. The arm can be almost twice as long, but compressed was long enough for this test. Problems: The small ~6 inch wheels are terribly bouncy and noisy at any pressure. Adding some weight certainly helped this. Lack of rotational joint meant there was often a barrow wheel off the ground when empty. Sharp turns brought the main beam in contact with the rider's thigh. Most of the weight is on two quick release bolts, so that's the limiting factor. These two bolts (one vertical and one horizontal) provide the freedom for the main beam to move up/down and left/right. On the other hand, it definitely worked and would let you tow the box or maybe 50 kilograms of stuff. I should have fastened it lower on the seat post, but that would mean the rack was unusable. That weird black arm is supposed to clip to the kid's handlebars to stop them turning while being towed.
395795	I'm unaware of any canon answers so I will hazard a reasonable guess. It seems exceptionally unlikely that Dumbledore would allow any policy or circumstance which made it impossible for a parent to visit with their child. Parents are, after all, the child's first teacher/protector/champion/consoler/cheering section and in times of triumph/stress/trauma, most children will turn to their parent. Dumbledore has consistently shown that the welfare of his students is a primary concern and so he would insure that all of his students could avail themselves of whatever parents/guardians they had. On the other hand, I think that muggle parents would feel exceptionally uncomfortable traveling to Hogwarts under most circumstances. I can just imagine one of Hermione's dentist parents doing side-along-apparation with Dumbledore. Generally, I think that the comment by Anthony Grist is probably correct (families of witches and wizards are more like squibs) and thus they could travel to Hogwarts. I think it's fairly rare though and that's why we don't see any instances of it in the books.
419075	J. K. Rowling's Draco entry on Pottermore, added December 2014, directly addressed your question. The biggest revelation was that he became less of a pure-blood fanatic: The events of Draco’s late teens forever changed his life. He had had the beliefs with which he had grown up challenged in the most frightening way: he had experienced terror and despair, seen his parents suffer for their allegiance, and had witnessed the crumbling of all that his family had believed in. People whom Draco had been raised, or else had learned, to hate, such as Dumbledore, had offered him help and kindness, and Harry Potter had given him his life. After the events of the second wizarding war, Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever, but refusing to follow the same old pure-blood line. Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’, but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension. Also, he seemingly mellowed out a bit, leading a life of leisure instead of working to overturn the forces of light or establish dominion over Muggles, like Lucius did: I imagine that Draco grew up to lead a modified version of his father’s existence; independently wealthy, without any need to work, Draco inhabits Malfoy Manor with his wife and son. I see in his hobbies further confirmation of his dual nature. The collection of Dark artefacts harks back to family history, even though he keeps them in glass cases and does not use them. However, his strange interest in alchemical manuscripts, from which he never attempts to make a Philosopher’s Stone, hints at a wish for something other than wealth, perhaps even the wish to be a better man. I have high hopes that he will raise Scorpius to be a much kinder and more tolerant Malfoy than he was in his own youth.
422231	****POTENTIAL SPOILERS**** As DDFirst Name Dd stated, I believe that Catelyn stated that Eddards Grand-Aunt married into another house, which I believe is house Royce, although I may be wrong about this. If for whatever reason these distant relatives are ineligible to inherit, such as dying without issue, then there would likely be another house who can trace descent through a grandparent or great grandparent to a direct male-line ancestor of Robb. Unfortunately, it would seem that Westeros, or at least the north, does not have a directly clear system for dealing with succession, and as such the claimant with the most direct blood relation to the current Stark's of Winterfell may not be the best potential claimant. In Westeros there are numerous examples of claimants with lesser claims being favored over the most direct heir, such as the first Lord Paramount of the Reach, who was granted dominion over Highgarden and the Reach despite the fact that while numerous Reachman houses claimed direct descent to the Gardeners through the male line, such as the houses of Oakheart, Redwyne, Fossoway, Oakenshield, Tarly, and many others. This is because in Westerosi culture the ultimate authority is the King. If a potential claimant has no real chance of holding said title, it would be unlikely that the current king would appoint another person to said title. As Robb is the King in the North, so long as that kingdom continues to exist, his designated heir, Jon in the books, if the will of Robb had been read, and only if Jon was willing to forsake his vows, and the other northern houses were willing to accept his as their king, then he would become the new Lord of Winterfell. However practicality would likely dictate that another, such as Lord Karstark, or possibly even a member of house Royce, if they are in fact the house that Catlyn mentions, would step up to claim Winterfell. In the end, the heir to Winterfell is whoever is able to hold it, be it a potential husband to Sansa or Arya, a distant cousin backed by the other northern houses, or even the Karstarks, any could claim legitimacy, and in the end, sucession in Westeros is not about who has the best claim, but who has the most power.
471424	Snape’s matches Lily’s as he loved her. The reason that Snape’s Patronus matches Lily’s is because he was in love with her, as Harry tells the Dark Lord. “You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?’ Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. ‘Snape’s Patronus was a doe,’ said Harry, ‘the same as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children.” - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 36 (The Flaw in the Plan) His Patronus is the same as hers because of his feelings for her - it doesn’t mean they’re related in any way.
516542	According to the Wikipedia article comparing all Canon EF-S 18-55mm version the STM version has (in addition to the new STM motor) a new optical design (13 elements in 11 groups vs. 11 elements in 9 groups), internal focusing and an extra diaphragm blade (7 vs. 6) So, the EF-S 18-55mm IS STM is not just the EF-S 18-55mm IS II with the new motor but a completely new lens that seams to be slightly better than the old design in every way. Even if you don't need the advantage of the STM motor for video I see no reason to buy the older version (unless it's cheaper), I also don't see a compelling reason to upgrade for someone that already has the IS II but the new STM version is better. BTW, you can usually buy seconds hand kit lenses for next to nothing because a lot of people want to get rid of them when they upgrade, a quick look on eBay shows that the EF-S 18-55mm IS II has been sold for as little as $40
808563	The reason for this is quite simple. While we orbit the sun, the moon is orbiting us. Look at the direction of the sunlight (this will show where the Sun is), then look at the position of the Moon. Let us take the Full Moon as an example. Imagine, in this 2D image, the Earth is rotating anti-clockwise. As the Sun is on one side, the moon is on the other. So Sunset and Moonrise will occur at close to the same time. Now let us look at the first quarter. At sunset, the moon is going to be almost directly overhead, which means moonrise occurred hours previously. Using a 2D visual representation makes it easy to visualise. Of course, it is not always so black and white, as the moons orbit is not a perfect circle same as ours is not perfect around the sun (hence different rise times throughout the year during the same phases), then there is axial tilt etc, etc. But this will give you a pretty good idea. The closer to the full moon it is, the closer Moonrise and Sunset will be.
1131494	I have had a cable of 30M be faulty, and a cable tester (albeit a cheap one) showed it as OK / didn't detect a fault. It may be that longer cables can be trodden on and that makes them less reliable(by damaging them). The kind of ethernet cables that I find to be reliable, have been one with a rugged jacket, they are expensive, and maybe a better quality build too. I used to get cables from a company that specialised in cables, but I just found them bad quality! But when I got a few rugged cables (and it would have been a specialist company making them), I found those were very reliable. So, maybe as a rule of thumb to get a quality cable, you could look for rugged jacket ones from a company that makes the rugged jacket ones, if you're willing to pay the price for such cables.
1227461	Another option is to get rid of CoreStorage if an OS X machine is available to you. This would also get rid of decryption if you're using it and you would have to wait until the decrypt is finished (plugged into power and booted into OS X, even recovery). You would need to boot to a disk that isn't the one in mind, preferably internet recovery (if available, command-option-r on reboot). Open up the terminal and do a: diskutil cs list The output should show your CoreStorage volumes and all, one of them is its Revertible status. If it indicates Yes then you'll be in good shape to proceed. Next you would run: diskutil cs revert /dev/ diskXsY (Where X is the disk number and Y is the partition number). You can check its status afterwards with the same "diskutil cs list" command. If it wasn't encrypted it should already be back to a standard GPT partition layout and you can try to mount it again in Arch. It should still be journaled which will keep it read-only, if you want to toggle that you can do so in Disk Utility. If it was encrypted the process will take a while but "diskutil cs list" will show you the progress as a percentage. I've had no issues mounting non-CoreStorage HFS+ drives and partitions on Arch myself. I did eventually move the data, repartition as ext4 and move the data back to them.
1500561	Is my solution reliable in the long term? No. A typical microcontroller IO pin has what is called three state logic or tri state: The pin can be in 3 states: Input, with the output driver transistors disabled, the pin is high impedance. Output low, the top output driver transistor is off and the bottom one is sinking current. Output high, the bottom output driver transistor is off and the top one is sourcing current. In your circuit, posted above, it is safe to assume the pin is always configured as an output, either low (MOSFET/LED off) or high (MOSFET/LED on). So it is always either sinking or sourcing current. When you close the switch on your diagram when the microcontroller output is low, current will flow trough the 100 ohm resistor, trough the bottom output driver transistor to ground. The only thing limiting current is the 100 ohm resistor so that bottom transistor has to sink 36mA. This is much more then a typical microcontroller pin is rated for and can damage it.
58198	One of the functions of money is that it acts as a common measure of market values as well as the typical medium of exchange. In the US, the dollar is that common measure and typical medium. Consequently, if money is involved in a retail transaction in the US, dollars need not be explicitly mentioned. An exchange involves at least two different parties and at least two different items. A phrase like "2 for 5" is an abbreviation for "2 A's in exchange for 5 B's," and what A and B are must be filled in by context. In the Us, at least either A or B is very likely to be dollars. With Burger King, which does not engage in barter but does sell hamburgers, A and B are likely to be hamburgers and dollars. How do you know which is which? You have to know that, at present, getting five hamburgers for two dollars is extremely unlikely. Language does not exist in a social vacuum, and people who write ads try to take the common understandings of the time and place into account.
128017	Well, within any discussion of literature -- any answer given on this SE for example -- there tend to be lots of ideas postulated. That is, simply, that they are taken as accepted truths by the writer, and usually by the readers as well. They are postulates in context -- simply the things we think we all agree on in order to be able to talk about the question we are answering. Of course, such postulates can be challenged and sometimes are. Here are some of the things that I postulate here on a regular basis: All literature is moral -- it is about a choice of values Literature is an experience, not a proposition All stories have story shape Story shape is driven by desire But these are just postulates in context. If challenged, I could produce argument based on evidence to support them. They are not axiomatic statements in the strong sense of a geometric axiom, for example. I don't believe that there are any axioms in this sense in literature. The study of literature is based on the study of aesthetics, psychology, and sociology, and I think that any statement you could make about literature specifically could be shown to be an instance of a more general statement in those fields. The danger in literature, I think, is quite the opposite though, not a dearth of axioms but gross surplus of facile rules of thumb that are often taken as axiomatic but are, in fact, misleading at best and outright wrong at worst. Finally, I think it is worth saying that the writing of a good story, despite all the advice on can find on structure, character development, etc. remains largely an exercise of tacit knowledge and skill. We cannot fully describe what we are doing when we write in objective terms. We learn it by osmosis and inform it with individual experience. If there are axioms, I think that they are axioms we have not yet learned to articulate, and I suspect we never will be able to articulate them.
139168	Worry about this later Names are easy. A quick run of Find/Replace, and suddenly, every mention of Corona is replaced with Prominence, or Flare, or whatever you want. Write your story using whatever name you are most comfortable with, and worry about the name once you get closer to publication. You should make note of any instances of the name that won't be easily caught by find and replace (such as the name getting cut short, puns on the name, or symbols based on the name, etc) so that you remember to change them later. That said, you probably don't have much to worry about. It sounds like you have clear sun related imagery in the book, so unless Corona is the first sun-related name mentioned in the book readers should have no problem making the proper associations. This is particularly true if your story is set in a secondary world, which will further isolate the readers from associations with real current events. Give yourself some time to wait until the current crisis is past and the media frenzy has died down, then give your book to beta readers and see if they comment on the name. If your beta readers report that the name Corona is pulling them out of the story, then worry about changing it. Not before.
217868	Infrasound. Those people are folowing The Hum. On our own Earth there is nothing conclusive about that, but it is not a stretch for it to be a real thing in a fictional world. What matters there is that the nomads either feel the minute planetary vibration on their skin rather than hearing it, or if they do pick it up with their ears, their brain processes it differently. Or they might be "feeling" the vibrations of tectonic plates, crushing against each other - the paths could exist along fault lines (and maybe magma plumes); As an alternative, rather than sounds, their ears might be picking up variations in the gravity of the planet itself (through the vestibular system). Our Earth's gravity is not homogeneous throughout the planet, though we are not sensitive enough to detect its variations. The nomad people in your story might be different from us in that aspect.
402926	Melkor, "he who arises in might" is as his creator made him. As far as Tolkien allows us to know, Ilúvatar understood Melkor's addition to the design and any changes he made to the works of others, only enhanced their beauty, functionality or overall quality in some way. This was as Ilúvatar decided it to be. As a creation myth it is almost necessary to have a force which opposes the general thread of the myth, lest there be no source for challenge, growth, development or change in the mythos. In his way Tolkien was ensuring his universe would have similar forces for change taking place through out the work. Does this inconvenience the creations? Yes. Does it force them to grow and evolve? Yes. Do they always make the best decisions? No. If they did, they would have learned nothing from their existence. Tolkien's work and his characters resemble most creation mythos with the strongest and brightest member of the pantheon having a frustrated itch they cannot scratch. Melkor's was a desire to create life, a power left only to Ilúvatar. Consider Lucifer who also wanted dominion over something that was uniquely his. I would consider everything that happened, as it should be, as Ilúvatar in his infinite wisdom allowed to take place. Could he change it? Sure. But if he did, what was the point of bringing Creation into existence at all if he was going to micromanage it?
440713	In the CW show, Barry Allen has gotten exponentially faster. in the start of the show, when he ran down a tornado, he was probably running around 300 mph, because the fastest tornado on record was 318 mph, and a young weather wizard couldn't have matched that. Later, in episode 6, he performs a supersonic punch, traveling at a bit over 800 mph. The speed of sound is 761 mph, and he was likely running a little faster to pull it off. Closer to the end of season 1, he accidentally time travels while building a wind wall while fighting the other weather wizard. Barry claims on a treadmill he was replicating that speed, with the treadmill monitor reading at around 900 mph. To artificially travel to the night his mom died, He was traveling over Mach 2, or 1500 mph. In the middle of season 2, he managed to leap across a bridge, which was calculated at Mach 3.3. When he acquired the tachyon splicer, he traveled "four times faster then ever before", which would calculate to around Mach 13.2. Keep in mind that his top speed so far is only 0.0015% lightspeed, so he still has a long way to run. But after the events of "The Runaway Dinosaur", who knows what he is capable of now? Perhaps he is capable of running faster than even Zoom! Zoom originally traveled at around the speed Barry could achieve through the Tachyon device. Now that his powers have doubled, Barry would have to run at 0.003% lightspeed, around Mach 27, to beat Zoom. This would be like trying to outrun a space shuttle taking off. Interestingly enough, if Barry takes all of Zoom's Speed (I think he might at the end of the season), then he could become faster than Voyager 1, the Fastest man-made object ever, currently traveling at Mach 50. Interesting!
554673	Both $U$ and $H$ are not directly related to any particular process. They are physical properties of the material being processed, and are unique functions of the thermodynamic state of the material, and not the process. They are directly proportional to the amount of material, and its thermodynamic state is characterized by its temperature and pressure (and composition for a multicomponent system). The internal energy is a fundamental property, but the enthalpy is a defined property given by $H = U + PV$, and is just a convenient parameter to work with is solving many kinds of thermodynamics problems. For a process carried out at constant pressure in a closed system, the amount of heat $Q$ added to the system turns out to be equal to the change in enthalpy between the initial state of the material and the final state of the material. For a chemical reaction carried out at constant pressure, the amount of heat $Q$ that must be added to the system in order for the final temperature of the products to equal the initial temperature of the reactants turns out to be equal to the enthalpy of the pure products minus the enthalpy of the pure reactants at that temperature. Both these results follow from the first law of thermdynamics. For a chemical reaction, generally both the internal energy and the enthalpy change between the initial and final equilibrium states. And what about cases where $P$ is not constant? What happens then? Can we calculate the value of $ΔH$? And does $ΔH$ even have a meaning in this case? Since $H$ is just defined as $U + PV$, we can always calculate the change in enthalpy between two thermodynamic equilibrium states of a system. $\Delta H$ certainly has a value in this case, even if it is not equal to the amount of heat added for a process between the two states. The critical thing to remember is that $U$ and $H$ are physical properties of the materials comprising a system, and are independent of any specific process.
977851	I've used WavePad from NCH Software for a couple of weeks now. It's a fantastic audio file editor. It has a few minor bugs in the interface, but does a great job of carefully controlled improvement of .mp3 files. NCH is in business to make money - surprise, surprise! So, they do their best to sell you other software. If you let it, it will install a thing called the NCH toolbar in your browsers. This has links to software that some paranoid utilties call a trojan. My wife installed it by accident and it took me all of 3 minutes to get rid of it completely. If you say yes to extras and demos, NCH will install things you may not want. On the other hand, they may be useful to large numbers of people. And, it's very easy to get rid of them if you find you don't want them. I can't comment on NCH's support, I haven't needed it. But, for a company that is claimed to have poor support, they go to great lengths to get your feedback and to provide software updates and access to beta upgrades. I have tried a couple of their demos, a video convertor, for example. I found it a very good buy decided I didn't really need it. The demo uninstalled quite well, but Revo Uninstaller found a few residual Registry entries and files that would have been deleted on reboot. That's fairly standard for Windows software and, if incomplete uninstalls worry you - get Revo! In short, NCH sells good software, so get rid of the trojan checkers and try using your brain instead. You'll find it's cheaper, quicker, less worrying, and much more reliable!
990836	Since you installed a new instance of Windows 7, all your programs will need to be reinstalled since they must all write to the new registry. I will assume that you have only one disk, but with two partitions, but even if you have two disks, I would do the same. First, backup your data if you have not already. You are doing a lot to your system, and if you make a mistake, you will be glad you did. Second, I would run some kind of serious disk checking utility to make sure your initial problems were not hardware-related (it does not sound that way, but now is the time to find out). I have professional tools to do that, so I am not sure what to recommend here. You could ask that in another question. You can then do either of the following: You can re-install all your programs on D:, and then move your data there. You could then free up C: for whatever else. I do not like this idea. Frankly, I do not like having my system partition as D, so I would probably save my data, then reformat the whole thing again, and put Windows on the first partition, C:. I prefer this because with the OS on Disk 0, partition 1, you do not risk partition changes that might throw off the BCD store (do a search here for BCDedit and look at the problems non-geeks have with this issue). Depending on the size of the drive, you could again make it two partitions (if so, leave plenty on the C partition...I would leave at least 25 GB, preferably 50GB, but that is just personal preference), or even just one partition. Of course, if you have two drives, one would be C:, and the other D:. You have probably not done much to your new D: Windows install, so you will not lose a lot of time this way.

2178529	Below are a few more sites that contain a lot of good composting information that you may find helpful/useful: Composting Council of Canada At Home With Compost: Clues on Composting The composter contents should be moist like a wrung-out sponge. If the contents are too dry, it will take overly long to compost; and if too wet, the contents may begin to smell. Troubleshooting If the pile does not decrease in size or generate heat, composting may need a boost. If the pile is dry, add water - mixing thoroughly. If the pile is wet and muddy, spread it in the sun and add dry material. Remember to save "old" compost to mix with incoming material. Create Your Own Compost Pile Having the right amount of greens, browns, and water is important for compost development. Ideally, your compost pile should have an equal amount of browns to greens and alternate layers of organic materials of different-size particles. The brown materials provide carbon for your compost and the green materials provide nitrogen, while the water provides moisture to help breakdown the organic matter. Backyard Composting Approach One 1 - Select a dry, shady spot near a water source for your compost pile or bin. 3 - Moisten dry materials as they are added. 5 - Optional: Cover top of compost with a tarp to keep it moist. Backyard Composting Approach Two 6 - Top with a 3-inch layer of brown materials, adding water until moist. 7 - Turn your compost pile every week or two with a pitchfork to distribute air and moisture. Move the dry materials from the edges into the middle of the pile. Continue this practice until the pile does not re-heat much after turning. Making and Using Compost Location Because the compost pile may need to be kept moist during dry weather, a convenient source of water should be available. But don’t locate the pile where water may stand. Excess moisture in the bottom of the pile can cause the process to stop or lead to odor problems. Layering Lightly water each layer as it is added. The entire pile should be as wet as a well-wrung sponge. Achieving this result is easier if you water each layer of dry material while building the pile rather than trying to wet the entire pile after it is built. Care of the pile Decomposition will occur even if a compost pile is ignored after it has been built, but it will occur at a slower rate. Adding water to maintain moist conditions and turning the pile to improve aeration will speed the process. To check the moisture content of the pile, squeeze a handful of compost. If a few drops of water can be squeezed out, moisture is about right. If no drops fall, the pile is too dry. If water trickles out, the pile is too wet. Cover the pile with plastic or other materials during wet weather to avoid excessive moisture buildup. Piles may be turned by slicing through them with a spade and turning over each slice. The main objectives of turning are to aerate the pile and to shift materials from the outside closer to the center, where they may also be heated and decomposed. Moisten dry spots in the pile by spraying with water during turning. US Composting Council
2240630	One more thing to consider is how the keys feel to play (I'm sure there's a technical term for it, but I don't know it, sorry). Basically the key resistance to being played. If you get yourself a cheap and simple musical keyboard, you'll notice very quickly that the keys tend to feel very differently - they tend to react to a much lighter touch which has its advantages when playing, but it works against you when learning to play (similar to learning to type on a mechanical typewriter like I did - still glad for it today!). A piano uses a hammer to hit the strings inside which requires a certain amount of force. Most simpler keyboards don't have that. So my recommendation is to include this in your search parameters and make sure to test a bunch of different instruments before buying. I used to have a digital piano (ages ago so I don't remember the brand) that felt very similar to a real piano, and it worked really well for my lessons and for strengthening my fingers.
2242177	An acoustic piano can be heard in adjacent flats and rooms by your neighbours. This may make you to practice less, avoid Sunday, do not use late night or morning hours you otherwise may have and the like. Acoustic piano may have better sound, keyboard feeling, external look and the like. However digital piano has sound regulator and the phone jack. Hopefully digital piano could be acceptable replacement at home. We do not need to have its quality better, just "good enough". Update 1: It may be regulations in some countries that defend your (or at least your child) rights to play the instrument as long as certain rules (silence times and limited number of hours) are followed, and the landlord may actually have no right to ban this even if it is written on the renting contract. I was not initially aware about this. Talk to your music teacher who must be aware. Headphones are still required to practice without any limitations. Update 2: It is important to understand the difference between the "keyboard" and "digital piano" or "stage piano". The lower end keyboard may lack multiple key sensitivity levels, pedals, be limited in range and polyphony, keys may feel completely differently, so understandable why many teachers see it only applicable to the very first lessons, if any. The differences between high end digital piano keyboard and the mechanical keyboard of the acustic piano are already subtle.
62053	They're not quite synonymous, although in this context some of them are interchangeable. Get back refers to the arrival. If you got back home at 3AM, it means you entered your home at 3AM, even if you've left earlier. Go back refers to the departure. If you went back home at 3AM, it means you left the place you had been at previously at 3AM, but arrived later, or even not at all. Come back refers to the arrival just like get back, with a caveat - if someone tells you to come back it means they're at the place they want you to be in. So your mom could tell you to come back home if she's waiting for you, but a friend you're out with would tell you to get or go back home. Arrive is more or less the same as get back in this context. Maybe with a little more emphasis on the journey - to me, arriving somewhere seems like a more arduous process than just getting somewhere. (Also, you can arrive somewhere you haven't been yet). Return in this context is somewhat ambiguous, although I'd read it as referring to the arrival rather than the departure. It's also more formal than the first three.
312226	I'm not sure this has a "right" mechanical answer. My sense is that it would be dictated by the setting and how all that stuff works in your game. Just as an exercise though, I can see a couple of ways to handle it. First, it could work a lot like the Necros in The Chronicles of Riddick. You kill the current Lord and you get his/her stuff. In this case, killing the Lord while difficult might not be nearly as hard as keeping your position later. Second, the Lordship could be based on being attuned to the magical nature of that level of Hell. Taking over means getting enough support (followers, magical energy, whatnot) to attune yourself to that level which would necessarily oust the current ruler. There are lots of other ways to deal with this as well. Probably a number of them documented in supplements. Regardless, I'd never make the solution a purely mechanical issue. Becoming one of the Lords of the Nine Hells ought to be very much a role-playing and story shaped proposition.
337938	Standard PHB Elves cannot grow beards (but Half-Elves can). As the PHB and the basic rules state: Elves have no facial and little body hair. and: Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. The fact that Elves cannot grow beards is specifically mentioned and is a known fact about the species - Half-Elves sometimes do it deliberately so that they look less like elves! You would expect a Belt of Dwarvenkind to cause a Half-Elf to grow a beard but not an Elf. You are, of course, your DM, and in your setting it might be different - you could decide that Elves can grow beards normally, or just that your special cursed version of the Belt of Dwarvenkind causes beard growth even in individuals who could not normally grow beards, such as elves or most women. Since it's intended to be a negative effect in context, it makes sense that it overrides the normal rules. BONUS PREVIOUS EDITIONS SECTION (a.k.a. I looked it up and now the question's changed scope I don't want to to just discard half my work) The subject of Elves and facial hair has been handled consistently since 3rd edition. 4e In 4e Elves sort of got split up as a race, becoming Elves or Eladrin. Eladrin, who are thematically more in line with the standard "high/moon elf" of earlier work, are described such: Eladrin can’t grow facial hair and have little body hair. The later description of Elves omits that specific detail: Elves have little body hair, but they favor a wild and loose look to their hair. However, the Wizards Presents Races and Classes preview book, which came out shortly before 4e's release and talked about the design of the edition, does state: Elves retain several of their distinguishing characteristics from earlier editions, most notably the pointed ears and the slight tilt to the eyes. And male elves don't have facial hair. As far as I can tell, though, no such item as the Belt of Dwarvenkind exists in 4e. 3/3.5e The 3.5 PHB, on page 15, says of the physical description of Elves: Elves have no facial or body hair. The same is not mentioned in the description of Half-Elves, which does clarify that: ... their actual skin tone, hair colour and other details vary just as human features do. (However, the 3e Belt of Dwarvenkind doesn't mention anything about causing beard growth.) Tolkien This particular facet of Elven biology appears to be in reference to the works of Tolkien which heavily inspired D&D; as per this answer over in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy stack, the Elves of Tolkien's works were almost entirely beardless, variously described as being unable to grow beards or (perhaps due to having to justify having accidentally described certain elves as having beards) only being able to do so when extremely old.
407491	I think the reason for other Kryptonians gaining their powers relatively quickly is that planet Krypton possesses conditions that are naturally more challenging that Earth, e.g. higher gravity, a less nourishing atmosphere and higher air pressure etc. Their bodies were naturally stronger and tougher upon arriving on Earth, providing intrinsically elevated physical abilities prior to yellow sunlight exposure. This may be why Kara seems stronger than Kal in so many iterations of the canon. However, I believe that Kal has a different advantage in that the amount of time spent on Earth, particularly in growing up under its yellow rays, has developed his ability to absorb radiation more efficiently. This therefore allows him to perform greater feats at full strength, making him unique and, ultimately, the most powerful 'superman'. (Note: I'm watching Man of Steel at the moment so this explanation is somewhat influenced by aspects of the movie's more grounded logic, which brings some interesting theories to the table.)
441070	So the question we're trying to answer here is how fast the Flash's top speed is right? If that's the case then there's actually a lot of ways to answer this question. In Flash: The Human Race, the Flash was able to beat instantaneous teleportation by absorbing the kinetic energy of everyone on Earth. By going this fast, the Flash ran faster than a planck instant therefore breaking what we call "speed" and "time". A planck instant (called planck time in real life) is the smallest unit by which we measure time and speed. So when the Flash ran this fast, he was everywhere and nowhere at the same time. So to beat instantaneous teleportation, the Flash had to go faster than a planck instant which leads me to say that instantaneous teleportation has to be a little slower than the speed of light. Before I get into more, I want to say that teleportation does not equal moving at high speeds, it's the transfer of information from point A to point B. This transfer, although seen as instantaneous, will still take time. Moving back to what I was saying before, teleportation is not faster than light. Einstein says that no information can travel faster than the speed of light. It's just not possible. But we go back to the Flash, he runs faster than a planck instant which is way faster than light. This is possible for two reasons: 1. It's a comic 2. He is not actually transferring info. He's just running faster than light by tapping into the Speed Force and absorbing the kinetic energy of all the people on Earth So there's my opinion on the Flash's top speed. However, we can also argue that the Flash doesn't really have a speed cap because there will always be the Speed Force. It literally says that since Barry Allen created the Speed Force and generates it with every step he takes, he can "reach any speed he imagines". If he wants to go faster than he just needs to generate more speed (sounds dumb and obvious, I know). The Flash's speed cap is therefore, unknown. We do know that he doesn't like to run faster than Mach 10 (7672.69 m/h according to google conversions) in Earth's environment because the results will be catastrophic. Just to let ya'all know, it was Wally West that ran faster than a planck instant not Barry Allen. Also here's a list of some conversions: Mach 2- 1534.54 m/h Mach 10- 7672.69 m/h SoS- 767.269 m/h (343 metres per second) SoL- 671 million m/h (exact value is 299,792,458 metres per second) Planck Instant- Undetermined. This is unable to be measured by the current technology that we have today. "As of May 2010, the smallest time interval that was directly measured was on the order of 12 attoseconds (12 × 10−18 seconds), about 10 24<---this is suppose to be an exponent) times larger than the Planck time."- Wikipedia
453663	They are not related, it is Snape's profound love for Lily that causes his Patronus to be a doe. The Patronus, asserted Spangle, represents that which is hidden, unknown but necessary within the personality. ‘For it is evident,’ he writes, in his masterwork ‘Charms of Defence and Deterrence‘… that a human confronted with inhuman evil, such as the Dementor, must draw upon resources he or she may never have needed, and the Patronus is the awakened secret self that lies dormant until needed, but which must now be brought to light...’ ... The form of a Patronus may change during the course of a witch or wizard’s life. Instances have been known of the form of the Patronus transforming due to bereavement,falling in love or profound shifts in a person’s character. Thus Nymphadora Tonks’s Patronus changes from a jack rabbit to a wolf (not a werewolf) when she falls in love with Remus Lupin. Some witches and wizards may be unable to produce a Patronus at all until they have undergone some kind of psychic shock. Patronus Charm by J.K. Rowling I don't think it is official known if Snape's Patronus changed at any point, however his happiest memories even from childhood were that of Lily Evans. Since the Patronus requires happy thoughts, it is only natural for Severus to draw on these. "But this is touching, Severus" said Dumbledore seriously. "Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?" "For him?" shouted Snape. "Expecto Patronum!" From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as he silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. "After all this time?" "Always" said Snape. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
526048	Just pick a choice at random. If you see no reason why one choice will be superior to another, there is no reason to let decision paralysis and the myth of "the right choice" to hobble you. Pick a look you want to go for, any look, and then start systematically selecting some from your endless tools and exercising getting to that look until you feel you can pull it off reasonably well. Note which process gives you the best result. Then pick another look, rinse, repeat. With time, you might develop a narrow "style" and create a toolchain for yourself which gives your signature look without much effort. Or you might find that you are a good experimenter, giving each new project a unique feel. Or turn out to be somewhere in the middle. In any case, whatever you learn while learning to create the first look, will make you better at making the second. And the first and second will make you better at trying the third. And so on. The decision to rely on presets or not is not really important. It resolves itself in the process of finding out how to get to the look you are aiming for in the current project. And please don't let others tell you that you are doing something wrong if you are using the camera's WB or similar! Most ambitioned photographers do end up doing most of that stuff manually, but only because they find that having the additional control makes it easier to achieve whatever they are going for. Once you have a goal towards you are working, you will find for yourself where you need or want the extra control and where a preset is sufficient. The constraints of film may have helped you focus, because each frame "counted" more. But you don't need external constraints to focus, once you know how focusing works. The upside of the unconstrained digital environment is that it makes it safe to fail - you have as many tries as you need to achieve good results (and don't forget to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good). These are the best prerequisites for learning - go out there, use them, and shoot.
793952	From what I understand, GRE is one of the lesser important factors in whether a department should decide to admit a student or not. Since a PhD is about research, research experience/potential/output is what people care about in this case, not so much numbers like GPA/GRE. If the department requires it regardless, then there's nothing you can do about that. But if it's not required, don't worry about it so much and focus on getting good recommendations and producing good research since that will matter much more. Remember that due to the current pandemic situation, people have had increased difficulty just being able to take the GRE exam. So generally departments are understanding of the situation. But even in normal times, GRE was just really a filtering mechanism, and not really the main point of attention for those responsible for graduate/PhD admissions.
1037274	I have removed the NCH programs in the following manner, on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit: Using Windows Explorer (located on your task bar at the bottom of you screen) navigate to Program Files (86)/NCH SOFTWARE. Right click on the subdirectory NCH SOFTWARE. When the window opens with the function list then left click on “rename” in the list. Rename the sub directory NCH SOFTWARE to ###.NCH SOFTWARE where ### is something that you can remember very easy or put it on note paper. Press “ENTER”. Double click the new name and you will display a series of subdirectories. Explore each one and use the “UNISTALL” programs as you find them. There isn’t an uninstall program in every subdirectory but you must use all of them. Close Windows Explorer. In the next steps it is very important that you make no changes to the registry other than the one I am going to tell you about. Click on the Windows emblem in the lower left corner of you task bar. In the “Search Programs and Files windows type cmd. The top of the search windows will have a section labeled “PROGRAMS” click on the program titled “CMD”. In the black window that opens type regedit. In the Regedit window on the left side is the display of the registry. Highlight “computer”. In the regeditor window in the upper command bar click on “edit” in the drop down window select “find”. Enter “NCH” in the find window and click find next. The regeditor will stop at the first instance of “NCH”. When regedit finds NCH there should be a yellow square just to the left of the NCH. Right click on “NCH” in the drop down window select “RENAME” change the name to “###NCH###” where ### is something easy for you to remember or put it on note paper. Press Enter. Use the “F3” to fined next and continue until the find box displays the massage “Finished searching through the registry”. Now reboot. After the reboot check your program list and it should be clear of all NCH software. If you are sure all of the programs are disabled then you can delete the sub directory ###NCH SOFTWARE in Program Files (86). PS: NCH is not “legit”. Any company that causes a program to be installed on your computer without your permission is not “legit”. Any company that designs their program so it is hidden from the Control Panel for removing programs and hides there “UNINSTALL” programs in the directory tree and then charges to tell you where it is, is defiantly not “legit”
1042985	From what I understand, MS-DOS is the disk operating system that Microsoft released. The command prompt is a non-graphical interface that allows you to interact with your operating system. Command Prompt is a command line interpreter application available in most Windows operating systems, officially called the Windows Command Processor but sometimes called the command shell. Command Prompt is a Windows program that emulates many of the command line abilities available in MS-DOS but it is not actually MS-DOS. Command Prompt is a GUI version of command.com in MS-DOS. cmd.exe is a native Windows application usually running in a Win32 console. This allows it to take advantage of features available to native programs on the platform that are otherwise unavailable to DOS programs. For example, since cmd.exe is a native text-mode application on OS/2, it can use real pipes in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the standard error in cmd.exe, unlike COMMAND.COM. (COMMAND.COM uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.) In reality, cmd.exe is a Windows program that acts as a DOS-like command line interpreter. It is generally compatible, but provides extensions which address some of the limitations of COMMAND.COM (above explanations are referred by Wikipedia).
1270481	/32 addressing Generally speaking, /32 means that the network has only a single IPv4 address and all traffic will go directly between the device with that IPv4 address and the default gateway. The device would not be able to communicate with other devices on the network. There are a couple of possible reasons for this that I've seen. It could be: A webserver serving multiple sites with each site bound to a specific IPv4 address A loopback address used for testing. Isolating a machine from the network to allow only statically set routes to connect. (For decommissioning, for example.) Network ID The network ID portion of an IP address is determined by the subnet mask. For example: A /24 IPv4 network has a subnet mask of 1111.1111.1111.0000, meaning the first 3 octets are the network ID and the last octet is used for assigning host IDs (256 available IDs, though usually some are reserved). A /16 IPv4 network has a subnet mask of 1111.1111.0000.0000, meaning the first 2 octets are the network ID and the last octet is used for assigning host IDs (65536 available IDs, though usually some are reserved). In the case of /32, this doesn't apply as the address is both a network ID and host ID. /31 addresses are also all host IDs with no reserved 0th address.
1316953	As clabacchio said, some capacitors are unpolarized, so it's perfectly fine to put positive and negative voltages on them. However, it is still possible to put a AC signal thru a polarized capacitor. This is done by adding a DC bias of at least half the AC peak-peak voltage. The entire signal is then still positive, but AC-wise the capacitor acts on it normally. Nowadays, polarized capacitors are mostly used for bulk storage on power supplies to reduce ripple and to provide short term high current. A nominal 12V supply, for example, may have 1Vpp AC ripple on it. That means the voltage is from 11.5V to 12.5V, which is fine for a electrolytic or other polarized cap. However, the large value of the cap will be applied to providing current to counter the 1Vpp AC voltage swing. Put another way, polarized caps must always have a positive voltage on them, but there is no such restriction on current.
1428252	Although some parts of the story are not completely clear to me, the overall situation seems to be a known problem. Why this can happen Connecting signals to an unpowered IC (in your case the second FPGA) is usually outside of that IC's specification (with a few exceptions, typically on ICs which are specifically designed for bus isolation - see below). Check that device's datasheet, to see if the input voltage specification mentions Vcc / Vdd, or a specific voltage. If it mentions voltages referenced to Vcc / Vdd then think about what that means, when the device is unpowered. If you need help interpreting the datasheet of your FPGA, then supply a link to its electrical specifications page, and we can try to find the relevant part for you. If you do connect signals to such an unpowered IC, then this tends to try to power the unpowered IC through the ESD protection structures on those signal pins of the unpowered IC. However the IC was never intended to be powered through its signal pins, those signals may be unable to supply the necessary current to power the IC (of course, they were never designed to do that) and so the signal voltages may go out-of-specification, the IC may not be powered correctly (since this method of supplying power was never intended) and a variety of incorrect behaviour can be seen. See the questions & answers to these previous topics, for similar problems: Isolate microcontroller from board and use other one Unpowered devices on I2C/SPI bus how to fix it? Use appropriate bus isolation ICs, which are designed to allow one part of a bus to be unpowered, without affecting other devices on the powered part of the bus. For example, TI and Analog Devices (among many other manufacturers) make such devices, depending on your speed, current, package, cost, availability and other requirements. In some cases, the 74LCX125 (which has a specification that allows for active input signals, even when it is unpowered) is an example of a type of IC which can be used to buffer signals to an unpowered device i.e. the 74LCX125 and the unpowered device would be connected to the same power rail, and therefore become powered or unpowered together.
2295828	You'll probably have an easier time using a picture hanger than a screw, and it will leave your wall in better shape when you remove it. Picture hangers transfer the downward force into pressure into the wall because the nail is mounted at an angle. The screw, on the other hand, is being bent because you're acting as a lever, where the stud is the fulcrum, the drywall is just empty space, and the wire is the force applied at the end. Even if you get a stronger screw, you're still placing a significant twisting force into the stud. You can't use your typical picture hanger for a task like this. The small hangers that come in most kits are rated to only 20-30 lbs. However, you can find hangers like this one that is rated to 100 lbs (and I'd still use two of them, since it will make adjusting for level much easier and reduce the risk of failure). The other option is called a french cleat which are two interlocking rails, one that attaches to the wall, and the other to what you're hanging. As long as you install them both straight and level, you don't need to adjust the mirror for level, and it distributes the weight across a larger area, reducing the risk of a failure.
188475	I know that the majority of the hills and valleys in Scotland, north England and Wales were formed by glaciation, and the rivers that then followed those paths. Based on that I would make the huuuge assumption that without ice, those "indents" into what was once the surface level of the ground would never have been made. This would give large and high plateau areas instead. Another interesting thing to note is that since the ice of the last ice age disappeared from Great Britain, it's northern end has been "bouncing back" due to the absence of the weight of the ice. That is, the northern end of the island is gaining altitude, whilst the southern end is effectively sinking into the sea in balance. Without the ice, this also would not be happening. Without the ice, the British Isles would also most likely still be joined together (one British Isle, singular), and probably also still joined to Europe as your lovely diagram states. This would likely have rather huge effects on the biodiversity of the Isles, the path human development and their cultures took, and all historical events that have resulted since human settlement. Edit: To clarify, the separation of the British Isles from mainland Europe is thought to have occurred due to "two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods" caused by the breaching of an extremely large lake under what is now the North Sea. This is not ice directly on the British Isles, but arguably the removal of that ice contributed to the breaching of the lake. Pretty big hypothetical you got there.
331476	EDIT: As @Wyrmwood pointed and I missed: assuming a BAB of 4 or higher Then I will consider it as so from now on. I believe the main advantage of Total Defense over Combat Expertise and Fighting Defensively is the possibility of a safer approach or crossing a threatened area generating AoO before your attack, specially with 5 ranks in Tumble. Total Defense is clearly a better option for those that need the extra AC now and are not threatening anyone and/or can't attack. Even more to those that also are in the threatening area of an enemy that you can't hit melee from your position (bigger enemy or reach weapons). Imagine these scenarios: • Level 9: Two Athach surprised the party in a closed space and you (a Rogue) are alone at the other side, with no way out except step between/alongside them. It would be hard to tumble all that threatening area at this level, unless you have enough speed and confidence. However, you may use your standard action to get a +6 dodge bonus to AC and try to pass alive against the 2 AoO. A level 9 Rogue, for example, usually have an AC between 21 to 25 at level 9, with +6 she goes between 27 to 31 against the +16 to hit of the athaches (+12 in a full attack). You may not have enough speed to cross this huge area, but maybe enough to reach to cross one and stay close to the rest of the party (at least close enough for the cleric reach with Revivify). • Level 6: An already hurt human Scout must cross the battle to reach the cleric to receive healing, but with 5 thugs on his way, even with his 40ft.(12m) speed, quick tumble while avoiding 5 AdO is too much (DC 33). Thanks to his Mobility feat (normal feat for as Scout at level 4 bonus feat) he already has +4 to AC against AdO for crossing this death corridor, using the Total Defense standard action, the aforementioned scout has +10 extra dodge bonus to his AC to escape his predicament and reach the healing mach..., I mean, the cleric. If you change to people that can't tumble his way out and have Combat Expertise (Fighters, Crusaders etc), both scenario are still true, but they may have a reach weapon that allow them to use combat expertise from relative safety, but everything goes down when you give longspears (or spiked chains if you are really mean) to the ogres or fighting a Gargantuan Monstrous Centipede, basically anything with more reach than you.
397301	Yes, Superman was really super even compared to other Kryptonians. (Or at least he was until the DCnU New 52 changed the DC Universe, yet again.) Under the original premise, as the Last Son of Krypton, Kal-El/Superman gained his powers due to the slow and long-term exposure of his body to the radiation of our yellow sun. This made him a force to be reckoned with in comparison to other Kryptonians because of his much greater strength, durability, experience and control in the use of his many powers. Superman and the rays of the Sun Yes, according to writers who wanted to boost Superman's powers in the early 1950's he gained extraordinary abilities after his exposure to the Earth's yellow sun. Early Superman was only capable of leaping a quarter of a mile and running faster than a freight train. These modest feats would still make him amazing by the standards of the early 1940-1950s. Take a look at these clips from Secret Origins #1. Early Superman being heroic, leaping tall buildings and chasing cars on foot. No, there is nothing currently in science that would explain this, so don't think too deeply, the writers who conceived of Superman's powers beyond those that were derived from Earth's lessened gravity. They knew next to nothing about stars, solar energy, radiation or properties of stars. They did not realize how little difference there is between a red sun and a yellow one besides color, energy output and the star's life-span. This exposure to a yellow sun would activate a process by which his Kryptonian cells would become super-charged and along with the reduced gravity of Earth, make him capable of a host of amazing superhuman abilities, making him one of the physically most power powerful beings on the planet. That said, over the years, there have been many reboots and changes to the premise of how quickly Kal-El would gain his powers (one continuity had him gain his powers as a child and have an entire career of superherodom as Superboy.) This was later retconned out of existence. Most tales now have Superman gaining his powers as an adult after years of exposure to solar radiation. This however does not explain the rapid speed that most Kryptonians seem to gain their powers once exposed to the yellow sun of Earth. In the new Krypton stories, the Kryptonians also possess superpowers and this was not after decades of exposure. So what makes Superman super? What make Superman super has been characterized by the RESTRAINT he has in the use of his powers. Even when Kryptonians have had powers from the sun, he was often considered stronger due to the amount of exposure he had compared to theirs. Current DCnU seems to be working toward the idea of Kryptonians needing time to gain powers under a yellow sun. Supergirl's spaceship had a device designed to charge her cells with yellow sun radiation. In earlier continuities, Superman was considered to have a store of internalized energy that had built up over the decades, making him stronger, tougher, with greater endurance than a Kryptonian who found themselves empowered by the sun but not with the longevity Superman would have had being continuously exposed to the power-giving radiations. His other advantage, played up by writers was his experience with using his superpowers. This may not be as apparent with the reboot of the DCnU but in earlier continuities, his experience being Superman, the use of his powers, the vulnerabilities he had to learn to overcome gave him a decided advantage in a fight with other Kryptonians. Imagine discovering yourself with the ability to hear all along the auditory range and not having practice discerning which sounds were important, how to differentiate sound levels, and controlling what ranges you were interested in hearing sounds at. Supergirl is overwhelmed by her new super-senses. Supergirl #2 Now add to that visual acuity through the entire electromagnetic spectrum, telescopic, microscopic visions, energy projection from your eyes, a sense of smell ten thousand times better than a human and all of this happening simultaneously in addition to having strength millions of times greater than you previously had before, all of this would make for a confusing time as you learned to adjust. Did I mention, flying? In the previous DCU all Kryptonians under a yellow sun, possess vast superhuman strength, speed, and stamina, invulnerability; flight; super breath; x-ray vision; telescopic and microscopic vision; freeze breath; heat vision; and super hearing. If they are trained properly, they will be able to use these abilities with some degree of effectiveness. Why does Supergirl in the DCnU appear more powerful than Superman? If previous continuities are any gauge, Kryptonians grow more powerful, the longer they remain under a yellow sun. So both Superman and Supergirl, assuming they do not deplete their store of internal energy (See Doomsday vs Superman in the Death of Superman) will continue to slowly grow more powerful over time. Supergirl has appeared in conflicts with Superman to be more physically powerful. Superman asserts he has spent his time as a superhuman learning how to restrain his powers to do as little collateral damage as possible. Exercising restraint often means having to take significant abuse on Superman's part. Where Supergirl, new to the fragility of the Earth's environment has not yet learned how to control the amount of damage she causes when she uses her powers at their highest settings. If this does not change, she will most assuredly kill someone, most likely as an unintended consequence of using her powers without a degree of discretion.
400406	There's no prize in assimilating Earth in the past. Borg are driven to assimilate species only if they can add to the collective. Humans are biologically inferior to species that the Borg have already assimilated. The Borg are more interested in the Federation's technology. Traveling back in time to assimilate pre-warp Earth would gain them nothing but a biologically unremarkable species with no redundant vital organs, etc. What the Borg ought to do instead is send more than one ship to assimilate Earth. We've heard about he Borg assimilating other Delta Quadrant species (like the one in VOY "Hope and Fear".) He spoke of 'hundreds of cubes' when the Borg finally got his species. Both times the Borg launched an attack on Earth, it was just a single vessel that juuuuust about succeeded. Sending two ships would be a better idea. Or three. Or fifteen.
843924	For a quick simple explanation: In both gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), you update a set of parameters in an iterative manner to minimize an error function. While in GD, you have to run through ALL the samples in your training set to do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration, in SGD, on the other hand, you use ONLY ONE or SUBSET of training sample from your training set to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. If you use SUBSET, it is called Minibatch Stochastic gradient Descent. Thus, if the number of training samples are large, in fact very large, then using gradient descent may take too long because in every iteration when you are updating the values of the parameters, you are running through the complete training set. On the other hand, using SGD will be faster because you use only one training sample and it starts improving itself right away from the first sample. SGD often converges much faster compared to GD but the error function is not as well minimized as in the case of GD. Often in most cases, the close approximation that you get in SGD for the parameter values are enough because they reach the optimal values and keep oscillating there. If you need an example of this with a practical case, check Andrew NG's notes here where he clearly shows you the steps involved in both the cases. cs229-notes Source: Quora Thread
907519	Size is the actual size of the file in bytes. Size on disk is the actual amount of space being taken up on the disk. They differ because the disk is divided into tracks and sectors, and can allocate blocks of discrete size. For a more detailed explanation, see this text which I copied from another site: We know that a disk is made up of Tracks and Sectors. In Windows that means the OS allocates space for files in "clusters" or "allocation units". The size of a cluster can vary, but typical ranges are from 512 bytes to 32K or more. For example, on my C:\ drive, the allocation unit is 4096 bytes. This means that Windows will allocate 4096 bytes for any file or portion of a file that is from 1 to 4096 bytes in length. If I have a file that is 17KB (kilo bytes), then the Size on disk would be 20.48 KB (or 20480 bytes). The calculation would be 4096 (1 allocation unit) x 5 = 20480 bytes. It takes 5 allocation units to hold a 17KB file. Another example would be if I have a file that is 2000 bytes in size. The file size on disk would be 4096 bytes. The reason is, because even though the entire file can fit inside one allocation unit, it still takes up 4096 of space (one allocation unit) on disk (only one file can use an allocation unit and cannot be shared with other files). So the size on disk is the space of all those sectors in which the file is saved. That means,usually, the size on disk is always greater than the actual size. So the actual size of a file(s) or folder(s) should always be taken from the Size value when viewing the properties window.

1438631	I would say that it does not matter, but there are trade-offs for each type of current sensing. Assuming the voltage source is always DC: High-side current sensing often needs a precision voltage divider to get within the common mode range of the op-amp/comparator. An option in some cases is an op-amp designed for high-side current sensing, but it may need supply voltage greater than what your sensing the current on. The sense resistor need to be greater then 1 ohm most times, and as high as ten ohms, thus loosing some voltage across it. Low side current sensing is preferred in many cases where you already have an isolated source. The sense resistor can often be less than 1 ohm so voltage drop is tiny. The penalty is if a serious over-current or in-rush current exist. It can damage a low-ohm resistor, so it should be over-sized if possible. As far as random oscillation goes, you can put a 100nF capacitor across the 10 K resistor of U1. In addition you have no bypass capacitors on your power supply input and output. At least 470 uF from U3 collector to PSU ground and from U3 emitter to PSU ground. One of the main reasons for using capacitors is to stop spurious oscillations. A 'loose' rule is 2,000 uF per each amp of current consumed by the load.
1893274	If it were me, with only 5 desktops to worry about, I probably wouldn't bother with it. There are 3 aspects to WSUS that make it a necessity once you reach a certain size: It cuts down network usage. Every update is downloaded once only. It allows you to set policies and be selective about what you apply. If you run bespoke, business critical software, WSUS is a must to allow you to withhold patches so they can be tested. It gives you a centralised reporting mechanism for seeing which machines have been updated properly. With 5 PCs: 1 is really not an issue and 2 you can probably deal with - If you only used boxed products, then it's incredibly rare that the critical and security updates will cause you any grief (Just don't install drivers from Windows update). 3 depends on how much control you give your users over their PCs and how much visibility you need over their update status. If you turn off WSUS, then I'd recommend giving your desktops a manual health check once a month, or so.
1898417	If you have a wildcard certificate you can do named-based virtual hosting just like you do without SSL. When negotiating an SSL connection, your web server needs to select a certificate BEFORE any http protocol headers have been received -- which means that, without SNI, Apache can't select between multiple name-based virtual hosts. This is why in the past you needed a separate ip address for every virtual host hosted on your system. Using SNI, the client is able to provide the server with the name of the host to which it wishes to connect. This allows the server to select the appropriate virtual host configuration, and hence the appropriate certificate. If you're using a wildcard certificate, you sidestep this problem as long as all of your virtual hosts share a common parent domain. In this case, SNI is unnecessary. Because the certificate is valid for any of your hosts, there's no requirement that your web server is able to identify the appropriate virtual host at the beginning of the SSL negotiation...which means you can use the HTTP headers to identify the host, and proceed with normal name-based virtual hosting. Using Apache, your configuration would look something like this: NameVirtualHost *:443 <VirtualHost *:443> ServerName foo.example.com DocumentRoot /sites/foo.example.com/html SSLEngine On # ...other SSL parameters... </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost *:443> ServerName bar.example.com DocumentRoot /sites/bar.example.com/html SSLEngine On # ...other SSL parameters... </VirtualHost> We're been running this sort of configuration in a production situation for a few years now without problems.
2247934	I'm not sure what you mean by “the natural scales formulae”, but it should be clear that any “natural scale” will not “naturally” have steps of the same size. The diatonic scales were discovered long before the 12-edo tuning that we now use for playing these scales on piano etc., and for measuring the size of intervals therein. The original derivation uses no equally-spaced grid at all, but defines intervals by their frequency ratio. For the purposes of “harmonic music” we basically need the Ptolemaic scale of just intonation. You get it by making the I, IV and V chords just major chords, which are the “ideal consonant sound”: I is, well, the base frequency, by convention we call it 1/1. iii has to be the the pure major third in the I chord, that requires a relative frequency 5/4. V is the pure fifth in the I chord, rel.freq. 3/2. IV is the pure fourth (so I will be the fifth of the IV chord) ⇒ relative frequency 4/3. vi is the pure major third above IV, rel.freq. 4/3 · 5/4 = 5/3. ii is the fifth in the V chord (one octave down), rel.freq. 3/4 · 3/2 = 9/8. vii is the pure1 major third above V, rel.freq. 3/2 · 5/4 = 15/8. Now... if you order these and do the maths, you'll find there are actually not just two, but three different steps! Namely, The greater tone is found between I and ii as well as IV and V and also vi and vii, with ratio 9/8 each. That is 204 cents (i.e., a little bit wider than a whole tone step on a 12-edo instrument such as piano). The lesser tone (not to be confused with minor) is found between ii and iii as well as V and vi, with ratio 10/9, which is 182 cents. Significantly smaller than a whole tone in a 12-edo. The semitone is found between iii and IV as well as vii and I, with ratio 16/15, or 112 cents. A bit wider than a 12-edo semitone. Now, while the major chords sound indeed amazing in the Ptomemaic scale, other things you'd like to do musically are complicated by all these different intervals; that's why most western instruments with fixed pitch detune the steps a bit, so the system becomes easier to overview for composers and players. The greater and lesser tones are reasonably similar, so if you approximate them both by one single size in between you can still have pretty consonant chords in your scale. That's the idea behind meantone temperaments (12-edo is one of these). OTOH, the semitone is arguably not similar to either of the whole tone steps, so if tried to also include these in a “one size, fits all” step, the chords would really sound out of tune2. But it's quite close to half the size of a whole step. 12-edo makes it exactly half the size, so your overall scale then lies on a fixed grid of semitones, where whole notes simply are a double step. 1It is widely accepted that at least the vii note, which is the leading tone from the dominant to the tonic, should typically be played higher than this value, to emphasise that the dominant is a dissonance that wants to resolve to the tonic. 2Which doesn't mean you can't use such a scale musically.
2428193	It didn't damage your battery or the charging at all. Because: All batteries in automotive created for simultaneously charging and discharging otherwise your car will not have an alternator in the first place. Your charger (SMPS type or Transformer type) has an output diode to maintain the current flow in a single direction, so the current from your battery would not affect the charger. Almost all chargers would work with a limited current. Even without a current limiter, the charge current will reduce constantly with the voltage increase. (SO don't worry about blowing up your charger). And all charger basically using voltage limiter And it wouldn't damage your electronic component in your car nor the alternator. Because the alternator has the diode to block the reverse current. The main concerns are: Your battery didn't charge at full capacity if your battery charger current is lower than your lamps. Your battery charger would be hot or warmer because it took longer than it should. Your lamps would be hot enough to melt some plastic near them, check if something out of order near your lamp. If your cable to the lamps using small wire could be hot enough to melt too, check it again.
119948	I answer your question for APA. Psychological papers are very rigidly formatted, so possibly you have more leeway when following MLA, but I would suspect that the basics still apply. To answer your question, we must first understand what the purpose of the headings is. To understand that, let's take a step back and look at the paper's title. The APA Manual says that A title should summarize the main idea of the manuscript simply and, if possible, with style. It should be a concise statement of the main topic and should identify the variables and theoretical issues under investigation and the relationship between them. An example of a good title is "Effect of Transformed Letters on Reading Speed." A title should be fully explanatory when standing alone. Although its principal function is to inform the reader about the study, a title is also used as a statement of article content for abstracting and reference purposes in databases such as APA's PsycINFO. A good title is easily shortened to the running head used within the published article. (APA, 2009, p. 23) As an article in the APA Style Blog explains, a title should not be a question: A great title gives away the ending. If your title is in the form of a yes–no question, try rephrasing it so that the question is answered or the answer at least alluded to. This primes the reader for deeper comprehension. If Philip K. Dick had written for an academic audience, you might be perusing Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: Empathy in Nonhuman Species before bed tonight. (http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/07/five-steps-to-a-great-title.html) Why does the title of an academic paper have to "give away the ending"? Let's take another step back and look at the purpose of academic writing. Academic writing, while it certainly profits from being entertaining, has the main purpose of transporting information. Throughout the APA Manual the basic requirement for academic writing is emphasized repeatedly, for example in the title of chapter 3: Writing Clearly and Concisely. The prime objective of scientific reporting is clear communication. You can achieve this by presenting ideas in an orderly manner and by expressing yourself smoothly and precisely. Now, if we want to understand what makes a good section heading, we only have to think of the heading as the title to that section and keep in mind the basic purpose of academic writing. Most academics have to read several articles each day, besides doing their research, writing their own papers, holding classes, correcting student work, and taking care of administration. For that reason, exerimental papers in the natural sciences all have the same structure, and the main sections usually all have the same headings: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion. For most natural scientists writing up their experimental findings, your question of phrasing a section heading as a question cannot arise, because the headings are predefined. But even if you deviate from this dogmatic style, your headings still have the purpose of organizing your communication and identifying structural elements: In scientific writing, sound organizational structure is the key to clear, precise, and logical communication. This includes the use of headings to effectively organzie the ideas within a study as well as seriation to highlight important items within sections. Concise headings help the reader anticipate key points and track the development of your argument. Taking all this together, if you wrote your paper according to APA stlye, your section headings must not be phrased as questions. But "Why Eating Vegetables is Important" is not a good section heading either, because it does not "give away the ending". A good section heading might be something like: Vegetables protect the body from oxidant stress that is: a good section heading will be the answer to the question.
266865	If we're talking hard sci-fi, I think we just come back to the usual problem that any attacker can just accelerate any projectile to near light speed and chuck it at whatever they want to destroy, and the target has no practical way of defending themselves. If you want to soften your sci-fi, then it's basically up to you what you want to make up to get around this problem. This might be a bit of a hippy-ish answer that doesn't mean the spirit of your question, but couldn't there be a negotiated outcome to this problem? Both factions obviously value the stargates greatly, and both factions have the ability to destroy the stargates at any time, so either conflict breaks out and the stargates are all very quickly destroyed, either deliberately or accidentally. Or, both sides sit down and hammer out a compromise - stargates can be used for space travel on weekdays, but must be reserved for religious veneration on weekends - something like that?
397300	What makes Superman Super (that is, extraordinary) is not merely the set of powers he has as a Kryptonian under a yellow sun. Those powers are standard for any Kryptonians on Earth. What makes him special is his personality. The way he uses those powers for good is what makes him exceptional. The story Red Sun is all about this, as it has Superman's ship land in the USSR instead of Kansas, so he's raised by Soviets instead of the Kents. But purely in terms of powers, he has no abnormal powers for a Kryptonian. Any other Kryptonian on Earth would gain powers roughly identical to Superman's. Admittedly the varying physical strength of various Kryptonians would still apply. So Supergirl would be physically weaker than Superman, simply due to her smaller size and lower muscle mass. It's unclear from the question what canon or timeframe we should be pulling from here, but in pre-New 52 DC Universe, Zod and friends escaped from the Phantom Zone and were physical equals to Superman. Later, the shrunken bottle city of Kandor was embiggened, which released 100,000 Kryptonians on Earth, and they were roughly as strong as Superman. Superman maintained an advantage over them in combat due to his greater experience with his powers. The other Kryptonians were used to their standard (roughly human-level) level of strength/speed/etc when they received their powers, which took some adjustment.
402929	Melkor's "fall" was that he wanted to make new things, that he wanted to go beyond the bounds of his own intrinsic abilities and nature, that he wanted to be more than what he was (there are interesting parallels to this in other "falls" in the Silmarillion & associated works, but they're for another time): But as the theme progressed, it came into the heart of Melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that were not in accord with the theme of Iluvatar, for he sought therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself. To Melkor among the Ainur had been given the greatest gifts of power and knowledge, and he had a share in all the gifts of his brethren. He had gone often alone into the void places seeking the Imperishable Flame; for desire grew hot within him to bring into Being things of his own, and it seemed to him that Iluvatar took no thought for the Void, and he was impatient of its emptiness. However: But being alone he had begun to conceive thoughts of his own unlike those of his brethren. So Melkor's discord was of his own imagining, but did Iluvatar create him with the capability to imagine this discord, or did he come upon it on his own? Let's ask Iluvatar... This is your minstrelsy; and each of you shall find contained herein, amid the design that I set before you, all those things which it may seem that he himself devised or added. And thou, Melkor, wilt discover all the secret thoughts of thy mind, and wilt perceive that they are but a part of the whole and tributary to its glory. (My emphasis) And (in case we were in any doubt)... And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined. This makes it clear. It seems to the Ainur as if they devised things on their own, but ultimately even these things that it seems to them are their own doing are a part of the Music as directed by Iluvatar. Just to reinforce the point; there is only one order of being in Tolkien which has the ability to go beyond the bounds of the music as directed by Iluvatar, and that's Men, and the ability was an explicit gift from Iluvatar: '...But to the Atani I will give a new gift.' Therefore to willed that the hearts of Men should seek beyond the world and should find no rest therein; but they should have a virtue to shape their life, amid the powers and chances of the world, beyond the Music of the Ainur, which is as fate to all things else... Note in particular the phrase "new gift" here; this is something else that no other being has had before.
631735	You want some sort of bootstrap or method for generating independent measurements of performance. You can't look at the k cross validation folds or divide the test set into k partitions as the observations won't be independent. This can and will introduce significant bias in the estimate of variance. See for example Yoshua Bengio's "No Unbiased Estimator of the Variance of K-Fold Cross-Validation" It isn't even really valid to look at best and worst case performance on the CV folds since they aren't really independent draws...some folds will just have much worse or much better performance. You could do an out-of-bag estimates of performance where you essentially repeatedly bootstrapping training data sets and get performance on the rest of the data. See this write up by Breiman and the referenced earlier work by Tibshirani on estimating performance variance this way If that is computationally prohibitive because you have a ton of data i'd wonder about bootstrapping or otherwise resampling just the holdout set but I can't think of or find a reference for that off hand.
1270523	What you're looking at are not subnet masks. They are indications of the length of the routing table¹ prefixes. A naïve implementation of a routing table would list every possible IP address so that, given any IP address, you'd look up that exact one and get back the routing information² associated with it. Clearly some sort of compression is needed. The nature of routing information is that adjacent addresses are likely to use the same information, so we can use a form of radix tree to compress these together. Here, briefly, is how it works. Given the numbers 0-7, we can represent them in binary as so: 0 000 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 Now if we have two routing table entries, one for addresses 0 and 1, and another for addreses 2 and 3, we can store them under the binary prefixes that these share. If we use a . to indicate the "unused" bit after the end of the prefix, we have 00. for the range 0-1 and 01. for the range 2-3. A standard way of representing this is with the lowest number from the range followed by the length of the prefix; in this case these would be 0/2 for the range 0-1 and 2/2 for the range 2-3. But what happens if we want to look up the routing information for address 6? Normally we'd add a "default" set of routing information with prefix 0/0, i.e., matching any bits at all and then when we search we look for the most specific information i.e, the longest matching prefix, we can find. So the full routing table we've just described is: 0/2 00. Matches addresses 1 and 2. 2/2 01. Matches addresses 3 and 4. 0/0 ... Matches any address. Subnet masks can be described with prefixes in the same way, and so this scheme is often used for that. But keep in mind that just because this scheme can be used for describing subnets does not mean that it's used only for describing subnets. As an example of routing table prefixes not being subnets, you could have two network interfaces connected to the same network, say, 192.168.2.0/24. (This could be implemented by connecting two separate network cards to the same switch, each with its own cable.) You could then set up the routing table to "balance" outgoing traffic across the two interfaces by using two routing table entries: 192.168.2.0/25 eth0 # range ...2.0 to ...2.127 192.168.2.128/25 eth1 # range ...2.128 to ...2.255 This would send packets destined to addresses 0-127 on that network out eth0, but packets destined to addresses 128-255 on that network out eth1. This is a bad way of doing this (for reasons I won't get into here), but demonstrates how routing prefixes and network addresses might not match. ¹ The Wikipedia article on routing tables unfortunately says that the prefix field holds the "Network ID." While this may be true in certain specific implementations of routing tables, it's not always a network ID in the general case, as seen in both the example you provide and my example later in this answer. ² This routing information typically includes things like what interface to use, what router to contact on that interface, if any, the MAC address of a host for hosts directly reachable through that interface, what source address we should put on the packet if the host has multiple source addresses, security information, and so on. There's a huge variety of data that could be there, but none of that is important for the purposes of this discussion since we're talking just about how you look up the correct data set for a given address, not what's in the data set itself.
1855229	I've had pretty good luck with servers from Aberdeen. They are typically re-branded SuperMicro servers. You may also want to look into Silicon Mechanics although they only offer 3 a year warranty. Edit: I should have also mentioned that Aberdeen sells on-site support contracts that are managed by a third party. They can tell you more about that if you contact them. I haven't had any experience with this so I can't comment on how good it is. My experience with warranty issues with Aberdeen have mostly been drive and power supply failures. For drives I normally keep a hot-spare in the array and a cold spare on-site so dealing with this failure is't a big deal. With their XDAS storage stuff I've had a lot of PSU issues so I like to keep a cold spare PSU on site if possible. But they can normally overnight you parts.
2162139	A nice way to tell the sex of a corn snake is by the shape of the tail. Reptiles have what's referred to as a hemipenis, and because of the way it's positioned in their tail, the male's tail will be thicker after the cloacal opening when compared with a female, who's tail will taper immediately after the cloacal. (Source) Another, potentially more reliable method, is by counting the scales after the cloacal. Simply count the rows from the cloacal to the tip of the tail. 130 or less is a good sign that you have a female. 140 or more is a good sign that you have a male. If you count somewhere in between 130 and 140 then it's not going to be definitive to say. In this case I would suggest also looking at the shape of the tail for that thicker section. Note: Unless you have an extremely well behaved snake, it's going to be hard to count the scales on it. So I would suggest taking a picture, or even using one if it's shed skin. Of course these are all going to be reliable to a fault, and aside from putting two snakes together and waiting to see if they mate, the only way to know for sure is by probing or popping the cloacal opening to see the sex organs. As I've mentioned in one of my other answers I'm against these practices because I believe it's an unnecessary risk considering the damages that can be caused by it. While it's debatable about whether or not snakes are less at risk to the damage than lizards, I would insist that anyone wanting to perform the procedure themselves have hands-on training from someone with experience (and that you can trust) first. Only someone with training should probe a snake. My suggestion is to try the non-invasive methods first, then if you're not convinced after that, you can take it to a reptile vet to have it sexed. As a new pet, it's a good idea to have a check-up from a vet anyways, so you can have it checked for parasites at the same time.
2219913	Acrylic and metal have very different expansion coefficients, so you need something that will not only bond with both materials but will remain flexible. The question isn't clear as to whether the metal will be sealing the snow globe (described as a jar cap). If so, the adhesive and the bond also need to be unaffected by the liquid in the globe. Common liquids for this purpose are water, glycerin, or baby oil/mineral oil. Water or oil can be a problem for many adhesives. Dow Corning DOWSIL 832 Multi-Surface Adhesive Sealant This is the best adhesive I can think of for this purpose. It's a silicone adhesive and sealant designed to bond strongly to acrylic and many other plastics and most common metals (not all silicones bond well with acrylic). This will also be impervious to any of the liquids typically used in a snow globe if it is being used to seal the globe. E6000 This is another adhesive that ought to work but I've never tested it for this purpose. It bonds strongly with many plastics and most metals. Once it dries, it isn't affected by the liquids typically used in a snow globe.
2240629	If you want to compare acoustic piano and digital ones, they are more or less the same instrument, digital pianos are just cheaper, lighter and quieter substitutes. If you want to be as close as possible to the feel of a real piano, you'll have to chose wisely and to still invest a good amount of money. The additional features (organ sounds and stuff) are mostly gadgets in that regard. If you can afford the cost, the weight and the sonic disturbance of the real one, there's not much of a discussion here. You will hear everything and its opposite concerning digital pianos: some people claiming to having played acoustic pianos their whole life would say this one is really good while other, of the same background, would say it is a complete steal and would not lay eyes on anything costing less than 2000 dollars. I would say you're good in the $900-$1300 range, and you surely can have a bargain buying second hand. Yamaha is a good pick, but Roland too, in my personal experience. If you know how to play a few chords, the best solution is still to go to a shop and make your own opinion. Digital piano might be as far to real piano as purists claim, but for now the only thing that matters is that it suits you. You'll have all the occasion to be picky in few years, when you're a more experienced player.
2404563	They will probably work out to be the same. An automatic transmission is inherently more complicated which means more can go wrong and usually does (more so than manuals). The increased complexity also makes them more expensive, heavier, less fuel efficient etc. A manual transmission is less complicated which means there is less that can go wrong. Through normal use a manual transmission should far outlive an automatic transmission with regards to absolute lifespan. HOWEVER, a manual transmission requires the use of a clutch which will wear out quite quickly relative to an automatic transmissions life-cycle. If you are not able to replace a clutch yourself (which requires removing the transmission) then you will be paying quite a bit more maintenance on the manual transmission every time the clutch wears out (anywhere from 2-8 years). With the automatic transmission there is less high ticket maintenance required besides fluid flushes. If your automatic transmission dies however then it will probably be at-least $1000 more expensive than the equivalent manual transmission to replace. So it probably depends how long he wants to keep the vehicle and whether he cares about having to replace clutches or is able to do that himself to save money.
2412073	I had a revelation after the manual transmission in my '97 Ford was replaced three times under warranty: Quality is more important than any inherent design advantage of automatic vs manual. As I see it, manufacturers make a lot of automatic transmissions and they put a lot of effort into making them reliable and durable. They don't sell many manuals in the US, so they don't put the development effort into them. As a result, I got a series of bad transmissions until they finally put a stop ship on them, and a couple months later I finally got one that lasted over 100k miles. But even though this one has been "trouble free", it is still somewhat balky and sometimes doesn't want to go into gear on the first try, especially as it gets older. It's really embarrassing when you roar away from the light in first and then can't find second. I see a similar thing with crank windows. Most cars have power windows nowadays, and if you find one that does have manual windows (like my Ford), they're cheaply made and don't wind as smoothly as they used to. I've never worn out an automatic transmission, or a manual for that matter.
2418715	Putting transmission fluid into your engine shouldn't have hurt anything, and as you've found out, may help it a little by cleaning stuff out. Obviously, it's not necessarily a good thing, especially considering if you have too much fluid in the crankcase. It is my opinion you should get the "oil" changed as soon as possible and try not to run it too long. The transmission fluid will not be providing exactly what the engine needs in order to be properly lubricated and you could be causing your engine damage by continuing to run it with the tranny fluid in there. As you've suggested, there is a real chance of blowing out seals due to having too much fluid in the engine. You also run the risk of the crankshaft hitting the fluid which can cause damage to the engine (if this were happening, you'd most likely already know it). Once the fluid is changed (along with the filter), you should be in good shape. Just don't run it too much until you are able to.
188651	I think the key hear is in how the elves are deploying the weapon. If its just a matter of the elves opening a jar and releasing the swarm, after which the insects, which I presume have been trained for this very operation, slide over to Earth space and explode themselves, then I would go for destroying the bugs before they go. If these insects are telepathically directed, then I would either a) try to convince who ever is controlling them that this weapon will toast them too, or b) neutralize their psychic influence. Also, here's a question for the those hear that are more knowledgable in physics: is their anyway to intensify the bugs containment fields, such that the field is so strong that it contains the explosive energy, much like a bottle of compressed gas? Also, if these insects are able to slide between dimensions, is there anyway for humans to "wall off" a strategically important site and prevent such intrusion? If I understand correctly, the elves are in a different dimension. If that is the case, then the "latest intellegence reports" would have had to be generated based off of a) some earth technolgy capable of peering into the Elven dimension, 2) some earth spy actually physically enter the Elven dimension, or 3) an intellegence agency interrogated one of the Elven officers that would know such information, or 4) a defecting elf gave or sold the info to Earth intel If 1) is the case, then technology that can look into other dimensions may be able to block incoming traffic or attack remotely. If 2), then there is obvious earth technology that is capable of opening a door, and thus may be able to close one as well. If 3) is true, then that means individual elves can be beaten, and if the leaders of this weapons launch can be eliminated, it might buy Earth more time or, if security has been that well compromised, even a way to detonate the bugs on the elven dimension. If 4) is true, that means Elves can be bought or moral is not 100% secure. This means that, given the right persuasion, the elves can turn on their military leadership and either destroy the weapon or themselves in the process. Overall though, the humans may be screwed, but there is nothing left to do but try and fight. Giving up only ensures death, or enslavement, what ever the elven object is.
303276	Yes, you roll twice as many damage dice for the spell on a crit The rule on critical hits on page 196 of the PHB says: When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add then together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. Note that this only refers to the attack - it doesn't say weapon attack, or anything else that would mean that this did not apply to spell attacks. When you get a critical hit with a spell attack, you roll all damage dice twice. So a critical hit with the cantrip Fire Bolt would deal 2d10 damage instead of 1d10. A critical hit with the 1st-level spell Chromatic Orb would do 6d8 damage instead of 3d8. And on a critical hit, Guiding Bolt would do 8d6 damage instead of 4d6.
375476	Since the other answers have been written, a card has been released that explicitly allows activating loyalty abilities any time you could play an instant: Teferi, Temporal Archmage from Commander 2014. He's a planeswalker with a relevant ultimate: −10: You get an emblem with "You may activate loyalty abilities of planeswalkers you control on any player's turn any time you could cast an instant." So if you manage to get him to 10 loyalty and activate this ability, you will be able to play loyalty abilities of planeswalkers at instant speed. It's not an exciting combo or abuse of the rules, but it can still be a lot of fun in a slow multiplayer game—exactly what the whole Commander 2014 set is all about! As for activating loyalty abilities multiple times in a turn, that is possible with The Chain Veil. A card first printed in 2015, long after the question was originally asked.
478059	I’d say she had a form of the Shining. I would argue that even Louis had the ability. Both communicated with the dead, and Ellie, as mentioned previously, had premonitions of the events to come. One could also easily look at Louis’ conversations with Victor as Louis’ ability to shine. If we look at The Shining, Danny Torrence was able to: communicate in some form or another with the dead, and Tony was Danny’s older, future self trying to steer him in the right direction to avoid death. Danny also possessed the ability to see the future in some capacity. It’s also arguable that all of the Torrences (at the very least, Jack) had a form of the Shining. It seems to be hereditary in this case if Jack passed it down to Danny. One could also argue that Louis passed it down to his kids. It gets a little tricky with Pet Sematary, however. It’s clearly a little ambiguous as to whether or not the influence of the Wendigo is what is exclusively driving all of our characters toward their collective fates. It influences Judd to show Louis the place, it clearly influences Louis to make the poor decisions he makes, so it could be argued that Pascow is telling Louis exactly what the Wendigo wants him to hear. I believe the Shining is an ability that cross-pollinates into many different King novels, and I believe this to be one of them. My opinion is that Ellie and possibly Louis have the Shine.
788183	Actually, you have a lot of freedom to do it as best pleases you. You could even create an alter ego (as I have here) under which to publish. But there are two constraints. The first is that you probably want to choose a name that you will be happy with over your career, so that people won't get confused by seeing different names from the same author. The second is that you want people to be able to find and connect with you. Mostly that will be via email, I suspect, but if someone calls up your university and asks for you by your public persona name it should be easy to reach you personally. If you just use the name you have used here, few people outside your own culture would even notice and just assume that your "family" name is Sabu. Some names in Western European culture arose in just that way. Others arose from peoples occupation (Taylor and Smith, for example). But people might also want to refer to you as Professor Sabu, rather than Professor Aaron, which you might prefer. But, don't worry that there are conventions that restrict your choices here. Assume that you have control over your own name.
2167722	Most of this is going to come from what I remember from a University assignment a decade ago. There is scientific evidence suggests that a cats purr can aid healing. A cat’s purr frequency is between 25 & 150 Hertz. google the low end is a similar frequency to the one that medical professionals use in vibrational therapies to promote tissue regeneration. Known benefits of a cat purring *Lowering stress — petting a purring cat can calm you *A cat’s purr can decrease the symptoms of dyspnoea (difficulty breathing) in both cats and humans *Lower blood pressure by interacting with the cat and hearing the purring sound *Reducing the risk of heart disease (cat owners have 40% less risk of having a heart attack. Probably because of lowered BP) *Purr vibrations help to heal infections, swelling, bone healing and growth, pain relief, muscle growth and repair, tendon repair and joint mobility
2291814	It sounds like the controller needs to be reset and the remotes reprogrammed. Usually this requires physical access to the opener, but if you have a hardwired remote it might be possible to pair it via the keypad. Check the manual for your opener. But back to the problem of how to open it. If the garage does not have an alternative access there should be a manual cable release which disconnects the door from the opener chain so that you can manually open it. Often this is in the form of a small key near your garage door. With the key you can open the lock and pull the manual release. (source: garage-door-automation.co.uk) If the installation was done correctly, you have one of these you just need to find it. If you don't have the key a locksmith should be able to open it for you. If you do not have a manual release then I think you will have to resort to breaking a window.
61274	The phrase by training basically means the same thing as the expressions by trade and by profession. I would even go so far as to say that they can be used pretty much interchangeably in everyday conversation. When you say that you are a lawyer, an electrician, an engineer etc. by training, this means that you received a formal education (or training) in your particular area of expertise. In other words, saying that you are somebody by training puts emphasis the fact that you are legally qualified to do your job. The opposite expression of by training would be by vocation. A vocation, simply put, is the thing that you actually want to do in life as opposed to what you've been formally taught in school as a profession. Yet another way to describe this situation is to say that although you studied one thing in school, something else has been your calling in life. Examples: I'm a mathematician by trade, but a writer by vocation. I studied math at the university, but have never really worked as a mathematician because I always wanted to be a writer. Even though I studied medicine in college, working as an architect has always been my calling.
193864	Heat drives a compound out of solution Heat can drive moisture out of a substance. If some substance mixed with water is a very viscous fluid, then driving the water out with heat could leave you with a solid. According to various pottery blogs, moist clay is about 30% water, all of which is driven out in the process of firing. A viscous mixture in solution (not necessarily a solution of water) could be heated in such a way as to drive off the solution and precipitate the results. I can think of a real life example of this: dissolve a pen's worth of ink in hair spray. Mixed together you have a black inky goo. When the alcohols in the hairspray evaporate, a hardened black mass is left. The alcohols in hairspray evaporate at room temperature, but just imagine instead a solvent that needs to be heated to be driven off. Chemical reaction at high temperature The second possibility is if the substance underwent a chemical reaction at a high enough temperature and changed into something else that had a higher melting point, then it could theoretically solidify as the temperature went up. Clay doesn't quite undergo this reaction, but it does undergo chemical changes when fired. Clay consists of a variety of minerals the most important of which for pottery are SiO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, both of which come from feldspars in the clay. Firing the clay burns off organic impurities, and removes the hydrated water and K$_2$O. Increasing the heat still further causes cross-link bonds to form between sheets of SiO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, forming a compound called kaolinite, which gives pottery its strength and hardness. Conclusion So it is plausible for a material to be heated and change its mechanical properties such that a fluid compound mixture precipitates into a solid material. The caveat is, I can't think of any way this could be a metal, since metal alloys don't form the strong covalent bonds in the clay example. It would much more likely be some sort of ceramic like the clay example. The other big caveat is that neither process is reversible. If you drive off a solvent with heat, then cooling down the resulting substance will not turn it liquid again. In the hairspray-ink example, you could re-dissolve the black mass by soaking it in rubbing alcohol, but it would take a long time (unless you ground the mass into powder first). Same with the clay example, cooling down the clay gives you hardened pottery, not lumps of crumbly minerals.
345977	If you want to base your D&D vision off Tolkien, of note is that two Elves in his works did have beards: Círdan the Shipwright: Círdan had a beard, which was rare for Elves, and silver hair like Thingol his overlord and kinsman. He was of great age at the time of the War of the Ring: perhaps the oldest of the Telerin Elves or even of all the elves remaining in Middle-earth. He may have been one of the elves who awoke near Cuiviénen and therefore without a mother or father. and Mahtan Urundil: Mahtan had a beard, which was unusual for an Elf, especially one as young as he. Elves could only grow beards from the third cycle of their lives, while Mahtan was an exception in being only early in his second. These both describe beards on elves being exceptionally rare, as very few elves are old enough, even at thousands of years. But it doesn't say it was impossible, only rare. It seems to me that if only one in a thousand elves had beards, it would be "common knowledge" that none could grow them. You can still make the item as obnoxious as you want working around descriptive limitations or descriptions in the PHB. Elves might not be able to grow beards or moustaches, but what about sideburns? Eyebrows? Eyelashes? Nose hair? Ear hair? Have the same volume of hair grow that would fill out a dwarven beard, but since there are so many fewer follicles, have the above grow to something absurd like 9 feet long. Additionally, have an NPC (or PC) who's not too fond of your elf player meticulously collect the hairs after they're cut off and continuously craft clothing out of it. This would also be a good reason why the Belt was "lost" or considered "cursed" in the first place--dwarves aren't likely keen on eyebrows to the floor instead of a beard either.
370699	Literally just played a game in which one of the stacks (the one containing 4 cards) was lead by the 9 of diamonds, and the cards inside of it were the King of Spades, the 5 of diamonds, the 10 of spades, and the 10 of clubs (I know this because I had the entire field solved except for this stack and used process of elimination). As far as I can see this makes the game impossible. I have a 9 of diamonds in which can never be moved, as the two 10s that it's eligible to rest upon are trapped underneath it in the stack face down. Attempting to get rid of the 9 by moving it to the diamond stack would also be fruitless, as the 5 of diamonds is stuck underneath it too. Unless someone can tell me some way that this could be solved, I'm pretty darned certain that if a card that is leading a stack is covering a stack that contains the two cards it is capable of resting on, and a lower number of it's own suit, then the game is made impossible right from the get-go.
398590	Angel's hair style is simple and no mirror is actually needed. I carry the same style and have for over 10 years. Shaving by touch is easy for a man, especially a man with a vampire's healing abilities in case of a wee nick, and Angel probably befriends a barber in town and pays extra for an after-hours, no mirror, no questions asked haircut. Also it is shown in flashbacks that Angelus had a moustache and long hair and Angel had a mullet in the 80's so they must grow hair. Just a quick mention, in After The Fall (the official continuation of Angel by IDW comics before Dark Horse got the licence and continued it with Angel and Faith), he does mention that it is hard learning to shave again as a human so that implies he didn't need to shave as a vampire, but I take any universe based continuity from those comics with a pinch of salt as Joss was not directly involved.
457614	The Faceless Men obviously have access to some kind of magic: When they wear a face their physique/body and voice changes as well. They can preserve the faces in the hall without rot. With that in mind it is easy to assume that a fully trained Faceless Man could have a stronger connection to the magic and be able to use faces of those that are still alive. As @Skooba puts it so well on his answer to a related question on MTVSE I'll quote some of it here: Jaqen seems to be the leader of the group. This would imply he has a greater or direct interaction with the many faced (similar to how R'hollor will "speak" through the Red Priests). While the extent of this is not fully defined, I believe this example proves this point. We could also speculate that because of this it appears he may even be able to use any face he wants and not just those of the dead. A few other speculations as to how it worked: Arya was "drugged" and so it was actually just an hallucination. When Arya joined the Faceless Men, even though not one of them yet, she donated her face, though subconsciously. This can also explain why The Waif appears to have Jaqen's face on underneath in the same scene. So any Faceless Man's, recruit or otherwise, face is available to all. As for what it means, well that's opinion based: She's been accepted into the Faceless Men. She's been offered up to the Many Faced God. etc. Overall you're not supposed to question the How's and the Why's... It's magic.
939081	I have used express invoice for a year now, and it was great until developed a bug. I was on the internet for days trying to figure out this bug, that I discovered other users also encountered. No solution was working including an upgraded download. I would have bought the paid version but was wary considering their support policy. Try contacting this company for anything..they make it very very difficult. There is actually no way to contact the company unless you purchase support. First two levels of support cost 40 and 57 dollars US and only entitle you to a very limited amount of emails from support...and they will only spend 10 minutes on each email. I chose the platinum support, 9 -10 minute emails and two 15 minute phone calls only from 9 to five for 63 bucks US, I must use them all over a three month period or I lose what I have bought and the cheaper support pkgs. Are even shorter in terms of access. So far, I have paid and they are already past the 24 hour turnaround time promised for a response. They also make you agree to no refund even if they do not fix your problem. Buy at your own risk, this company has blatantly decided to make support a frustrating endeavor for their users.
1236302	Is a way to open and access the cropped version of the image or other information in the .AAE file? .aae files are only used by iOS and OS X 10.10+. They can be viewed by a text editor to see what edits were made to the photo, but won't allow you to access the modified photo in Windows. An AAE file contains edits made to an image using the Photos app on an iOS device. It is used to transfer non-destructive edits a user has made to .JPG images in iOS to the macOS system. AAE files can be found accompanying the images for which they contain edits. More Information AAE files are used by iOS 8 and later and OS X 10.10 and later. If you import pictures from an iOS device to Windows, the JPEG images will only get transferred and not the AAE files, which will cause you to lose your edits. Also, AAE files can be deleted without erasing your pictures but any edits made to them will be removed. The AAE file is referenced by the Photos app when opening the JPG file in which it is associated. It can also be opened by text editors such as TextEdit and Notepad to view the edits made to the corresponding photo. Source .AAE File Extension So how can I access the modified photo on Windows? Use any other photo editing app on your iOS device. Open the app and import the photo in it, and then save it again without making any changes. The only thing you need to be careful of here is that the app you use doesn’t add a watermark and that it doesn’t compress the photo, or crop it. You’re obviously going to want a free app in this case so we recommend Snapseed by Google or Darkroom by Adobe. Both let you save a copy of a photo without having to make single change to it. Once you’ve saved a copy, simply connect your phone to your PC/Mac and copy it from the device’s storage like you would any other photo.

2295908	The neutral and ground MUST NOT be bonded at a sub-panel. They should only be bonded at the main service panel. If you bond them anywhere other than the main service, the neutral return current now has multiple paths, including though your ground wire. You should be able to buy a second bar for the sub-panel if it really is meant to be used as a sub-panel. The neutral bar will need to be isolated (it should have plastic insulator separating it from the case). The ground bar should be bonded to the case. The ground wire from the house must be connected to the sub-panel ground. Since it is a detached building the ground rods are also required by code and should be tied to the sub-panel ground. The ground to the service is the most important because it will provide the low resistance path back to the service in case of a fault.
155949	Disclaimer: My science levels are all over the place so this may not be 100% accurate. I'm specifically concerned about my first paragraph which is a alternative interpretation of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. It takes a different view on the matter, one that I feel is correct but am not certain of. I added a second concrete example to illustrate the thought process. Slightly unrelated is Turing's Proof which rankles me and may be related to decoding the universe. See Note2 for an argument on Turing's Proof that I way more certain of than I am of my argument on Gödel. Our current math theorems only tells us that we can never have a complete system in the sense that we can never know with certainty that our axioms and such are complete, etc. But this rides on the assumption that the parts our math doesn't allow us to grasp aren't the ones that override this assumption. (Our current axiom set roughly says "You can't have all the rules because you can't logically get to some of them, no matter what set of axioms you pick" but there may be a rule that we have to hit by chance or take on faith, since we can't get to it logically by our current axiom set per Gödel, that translates out to roughly: "Disregard all other rules. The last axiom of math is the 5th item on your shopping list on every billionth day. Just take my word for it."). Like all science we may discover that we need to rewrite the axioms when we hit new areas of math. This could open the way to us discovering the true set of axioms that explains all (if they exist). That is, by virtue of logic failing we could potential be forced to have our minds wander until we hit the right answer by chance (which sounds a lot like the current state of affairs for our current search for a ToE). A good example for the possible last axiom (well, maybe for a moral system and not a mathematical one) would be the rule: "Everything is a grey-area of some extent, there are no black and white rules." which seems decent if you can apply it to just about everything. But when you get around applying that rule to itself it becomes a statement of "Sometimes things are black and white, because this rule is a grey-area itself." So do you edit it to "Everything is grey except for this rule." or do you take it as it stands or do you toss it completely. The right course of action seems difficult. Assuming that this is one of the true axioms of the universe the two framings have different outcomes: strict rules with a loophole written in (that may or may not be exploited by the universe at any given moment), or with exceptions only for themselves. Either way its status as an axiom relegates it to the "take it on faith" principle which in the case of this self-paradoxical rule is a little harder to swallow that 1+1=2. So even if the universe is deterministic to a fault we would most likely need a lucky guess or a change in mathematics to get all the rules right. It could be that even without perfect rules we could move towards a snapshot of the universe at time T. Our certainty would never reach 100% but we could get very very close. If your predicting the future accurately left and right though, then you pretty much don't care if you're 100% right, you might just assume you are spot-on which is basically what Bayesian statistics would tell you. Sure you missed that thing-a-ma-what's-it axiom, but that only causes a simulation glitch once every billion years... Do you care? If the universe is boot-strappable from a small set of data and has implicit T states, then we could operate on all of this data and recreate a time-location-state(which is what you're asking, so this is the caveat). The simulation could even reduce as far as a random seed number. This may be a number with only finite possibilities. We could test the parameters until we reached one that modeled our current T value correctly. This would get us to the point of modeling the universe without violating the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle or any other building blocks. If the universe fails any of these assumptions (is not deterministic, etc.), then our math can give us possible futures with error measures. You could extract information as long as your signal-to-noise ratio for the universe was relatively decent. Non-implicit universes would have diminishing returns on the signal over time and increased noise (which would model our heat as information loss perfectly!). Note: Figured I'd add that our current science makes the needed assumptions when it assumes to know the effects of the constants on the universe. "Our Constants are so finely tuned it must be the work of an intelligent design". What gets more in the way is the problem of storing a given snapshot of the universe so that we can compute on it. If there isn't a small boot-strappable data set then it can't be done. There are various physical effects that operate as a whole and not additively, so you would need an atom to record all the information about that atom, etc. resulting in the universe. Otherwise you'd need a frequent snapshot of the area of interest to work off of. If you could acquire a frequent snapshot of an area there becomes little need to forecast very far ahead which reduces the error we can have in T+1 allowing more inaccurate rules. (Our weather forecasting is an example. Snapshots of poor detail are acquired and a simulation plots out 7 days. Days closer to the start of the simulation are more accurate. Increasing resolution, simulation frequency, or computing power increases accuracy overall). Note2: So this isn't directly related except for the fact that if I'm right all of a sudden we can compute Chaitin's Constant which will probably give us a decent platform to create our boot-strappable data set (it also flirts with violating Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems)... So Turing's Proof has always rankled me because it amounts to saying "If you give me a program H that computes Halt() I can give you a program B that always invalidates H" the problem is that his formulation involves B containing H which amounts to saying "I can construct a wrapper function/super-set to H that invalidates it" so the implicit assumption is B is always bigger than H. You can in fact (I wrote a proof) construct an H that uses B to expand itself recursively. This makes sure H is always able to get the correct solution for Halt() as long as H is at-least 1 bit larger than B. If you extend this out to infinity then technically Turing's Proof is right because both H and B will end up at the same infinite size and we can't decide when their the same size (at-least my function can't, although it would be possible if you made a quantum extension of my algorithm (but that may give B new tricks of subverting H as written)) so we end up with an infinitesimal fraction of all programs that are undecidable. But that just means your constant has an infinitesimal error and so is still usable for our purposes. Edit2: Oh yeah your questions... How precise of an estimation could we get of the future? It depends, see the other answers. Can a weather forecast for the next day be 100% reliable? I'm pretty sure we can already do this, we just don't run them every day. It's run the minimum amount of times for tolerable accuracy because weather "people"/stations pool money to run a simulation on a supercomputer (or they did anyway...) Can we answer questions like "if hitler had died as a kid" with 100% reliability? If we achieve exactly 99.999% accuracy in our rule set for time-steps of 1 yr (noting we'll never reach 100% unless we just take it on faith and it turns out to actually be our magical rule set) and get a perfect snapshot today (2014) then your looking at 99.874% accuracy on our Hitler predictions. So no, not 100% at that point but pretty damn close. How much further could we predict from T, with good accuracy, knowing that there is randomness? Well if you compute Chaitin's Constant for your universe you can actually predict your randomness given enough bits of information (this is exactly the same as predicting the seed of a random number generator given x bits where Chaitin's is your seed and the rule set is the generator. You tweak things snipped long explanation until your correct and then randomness doesn't matter). If we take the other track and assume you can't then you have the same situation as for the Hitler situation. The perfection of your rule set determines how close you can get. You multiply the accuracy every time-step (so starting with .999999999999 you lose 1 off the least significant digit each step and there are Z steps each second which is at least the speed of light divided by the number of planck lengths in a meter in magnitude (so 1.855492(18) x10^43) which means for an accuracy to the 12 decimal place you lose at least (.999999999999 accuracy to the 2 x10^43 ticks/sec to the 31600800 sec/yr) .2% accuracy each year (I think I did that right...)). So if we place our limit for good accuracy at 90% then we have 50 years.
402928	Not only was Melkor given the greatest gift of power and knowledge of all the Ainur, he also shared in all the abilities of all the others. The Ainur were said to know only the part of the mind of Ilúvatar from where they came, and so he was closest in all things to Ilúvatar himself. Perhaps this is why he was not as content with merely expounding the theme of Ilúvatar.. To the question of why he was tolerated: “[Ilúvatar: ] 'Seest thou not how here in this little realm in the Deeps of Time Melkor hath made war upon thy province? He hath bethought him of bitter cold immoderate, and yet hath not destroyed the beauty of thy fountains, nor of my clear pools. Behold the snow, and the cunning work of frost! Melkor hath devised heats and fire without restraint, and hath not dried up thy desire nor utterly quelled the music of the sea. Behold rather the height and glory of the clouds, and the everchanging mists; and listen to the fall of rain upon the Earth! And in these clouds thou art drawn nearer to Manwe, thy friend, whom thou lovest.' J.R.R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion. (To which Ulmo responded that he had neither anticipated rain nor conceived of snow).
402987	No. As is demonstrated many times in the series, if there is bloodlines to work out, people will tend to do that to find out who the heir is, for example: The complex Arryn family tree ends with Harry the Heir The Frey constantly argue about their lines of succession There are also examples when people just take what they want with physical force or general consensus, such as the dothraki and ironborn, or the wildlings. Or in a rather general way, the way Robert took his throne, and Renly tried to, by combination of both. A convoluted bloodline has also been the Blackfyres' biggest motivation. I believe that there will always be heirs to be found in major houses. You might have to go back through the generations, but I doubt very much that anyone would ever resort to such generic family ties as those between Stark and Karstark. If no "direct" blood relative could be found, whatever the king or ruling house in the north would probably decide who takes over Winterfell. And anyone who takes Winterfell without the support of the North would probably sit rather insecurely on their lordship.
448692	I know I'm late to answer this but I think the answer to that might be more meta in nature. Perhaps the reason why Clint was not entranced by Wanda's magic is simply because the Hawkeye character, as far as the MCU goes, has very little development in his past. I.e. there's nothing really to show the viewers if Wanda were cause him to hallucinate. Aside from the Avengers context we know little about Clint. And I know you might say the same thing for Natasha / Black Widow, but she's a bit more fleshed out as a character in spite of not having her own movie to show flashbacks to. Clint is the perfect candidate to stop Wanda but also be easily stopped by her brother and whose omission of their past is inconsequential to the viewer. As well he also filled the role of being the guy to pilot the ship back and provide a safe haven for the Avengers when they retreat with their tails between their leg. Had he been affected to, there might not have been that opportunity. His private life was a good plot device.
843926	The inclusion of the word stochastic simply means the random samples from the training data are chosen in each run to update parameter during optimisation, within the framework of gradient descent. Doing so not only computed errors and updates weights in faster iterations (because we only process a small selection of samples in one go), it also often helps to move towards an optimum more quickly. Have a look at the answers here, for more information as to why using stochastic minibatches for training offers advantages. One perhaps downside, is that the path to the optimum (assuming it would always be the same optimum) can be much noisier. So instead of a nice smooth loss curve, showing how the error descreases in each iteration of gradient descent, you might see something like this: We clearly see the loss decreasing over time, however there are large variations from epoch to epoch (training batch to training batch), so the curve is noisy. This is simply because we compute the mean error over our stochastically/randomly selected subset, from the entire dataset, in each iteration. Some samples will produce high error, some low. So the average can vary, depending on which samples we randomly used for one iteration of gradient descent.
2380370	Yeah, it's like overkill if you're riding on the street. I use a Busch & Muller lamp powered by a dynamo hub and it puts out plenty of light even when riding downhill on potholed roads. Also keep in mind lumens is only one factor in determining light quality. It's sort of like having a computer with a fast processor but not enough memory. More important are the actual optics which disburse the light. A lot of lights - even really expensive ones - come with nothing more than a plain lens on them which means a lot of the light they put out isn't lighting up the ground in front of you. No point in having 750 lumens if most of it doesn't illuminate the ground in front of you. Peter White has some good examples of how important beam pattern is in determining how good a light is in the real world: http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/headlights.asp Another problem is where the light is mounted. A powerful light mounted up high (helmet or handlebars) can wash out the terrain making it tricky to spot a pothole. There's a reason why randonneurs - who often ride throughout the night - prefer to mount their lights lower (usually on the fork) If people are wincing when you approach then your light is almost certainly aimed too high.
257385	Cube or rectangular The shape will depend on a lot of factors, so I will make some assumptions. I am assuming you have artificial gravity, so no need for long rotating cylinders or donut shapes. I am assuming that the shape has no influence in space due to speed or ftl travel. Since it is built in space I assume some standard manufacturing. This is quite important since one-offs space ships can be completely different. The most efficient way of constructing large objects is quite often modular. You can have a lot of factories creating modular modules which will be coupled together to create a spaceship. Modules will probably be rectangular in certain sizes for easy assembly. Basically you would stack them like cargo containers. They would also be rectangular since flat surfaces that you can screw together are much easier to make than rounded surfaces. That goes for the outside, but also for all machinery on the inside. In the real world, things are usually rounded only for function or aesthetics. In the case of aesthetics most machines on the inside are quite square. If for some reason you would need a sphere shape, for less outer area compared to volume you would probably only make the outer shape spherical, much like rounded office buildings. As a last remark, for slower than light colonial ships I believe hollowing out asteroids (or clomping them together depending on the wanted size) and covering them in a thick sheet of ice as protection for interstellar radiation would be most efficient.
372106	There used to be a long shot that could make this happen: You start by playing the Mycosynth Lattice which turns all your permanents into artifacts, including planeswalkers. Then you play March Of the Machines, turning your planeswalker into an artifact creature with power and toughness equal to its casting cost. Then you use the ability of an Experiment Kraj to put a +1/+1 counter on the planeswalker artifact creature. Now since the planeswalker artifact creature has a +1/+1 counter on it, the Experiment Kraj can use all of the activated abilities of the planeswalker without any of the restrictions of a planeswalker. Sadly since the time of that post they have extensively written into the rules that there is no way to use a loyalty ability of a permanent in any way other than a sorcery and it can only be used once per turn. 209.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent he or she controls any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn, but only if none of that permanent's loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, "Loyalty Abilities." 606.3. A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent he or she controls any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn. To date with the exception of copying an activated ability, there is no way to use a loyalty ability more than once and you can never use them at a time other than when you could cast a sorcery, because they have restricted the use of the loyalty ability itself, not just the way a planeswalker specifically uses them.
1987437	This is a tough problem. I think the easiest method would be to prepare a hard disk with a completely configured OS and just ship it to the remote location and have them install it into this machine. After all, this is not rocket science and can be done by untrained people with proper directions. If that's not possible, you will need at least the possibility to add some statements to the DHCP server (next-server and filename) for this machine to allow booting via PXE from the linux server, and a static IP address for the machine from the DHCP. After that, I would try to boot a live system via PXE and use it to download an image of an installed system and drop it onto the disk with dd or something similar. It should also be possible to prepare a kickstart file for CentOS (or Fedora) that allows to completely install a system without any interaction (via PXE), but getting this right will take a lot of time.
2188979	It is very important to keep water and temperature in balance in a compost heap. The bacteria need water to assist the decomposition process, but too much water will slow down or stop the process completely. Water should be added little and often, but only as necessary. A handy tool for compost is a thin slightly rusty iron rod about 4 feet long. Shove the rod into the pile using your best rapier thrust technique, and as you do this feel the consistency of the materials it passes through. Maybe you feel twigs and other hard stuff, maybe it is consistently smooth and open. Push in as far as it will go and pull it back out, and inspect the surface of the rod for signs of dryness or physical water. Then put the rod back in and leave it there for half an hour, then withdraw again and feel the temperature of the rusty rod, getting your hands nicely dirty and feeling the quality of the compost it passed through. If your hands get really smeary dirty the pile is probably too wet already and needs drying out and rebuilding. If the rod feels cool or only slightly warm then the engine is not running. Maybe it has finished decomposing, or it's time to rebuild the heap, moisturizing, but not wetting, as required. Buckets of water are only required if the pile is running really hot and shows a dry rod test.
2380374	Yes. Blinding oncoming traffic is certainly not in your best interest. Operating multiple running lights like you see on a semi truck would be better than purchasing a high power front or rear facing light. A brighter rear red light, with a touch of blue for colorblindness like stoplights have, is good to see you from behind. A more powerful front facing light will generally not increase reaction time of oncoming traffic. Drivers will have to make out your shape to influence reactions. While the oncoming driver is blinded, you are reducing the time they have to ensure your safety. To explain the point people are making here. Imagine a house at the end of a dark street. The home owners point the super bright lights towards oncoming traffic. Drivers are unlikely to make out the fact there is a house because of the high power lights and the property is suffering traffic damage. When the owner finally turns the lights around towards the home, blinding drivers was then stopped and the shape of home was made out at a much further distance allowing safe traffic to resume. So definitely have your headlight. Just keep it dim enough where it is comfortable for you and everyone else to look directly into and aim it properly. If it blinds you, you bet it's going to blind traffic. Increasing lumens of an already good light will not increase your safety. It might, however, make you a target if they are airplane runway bright. If your friends are saying it is too bright, you should pay attention to them.
59172	All three of your sentences are grammatically well-formed, but they mean different things. I wasn't able to ride a bike until I was 20 means that you learned how to ride a bike when you were 20—before that you could not ride a bike. I was able to ride a bike until I was 20 means that before you were 20 you were able to ride a bike but at that age something happened—perhaps you lost a leg!—after which you were no longer able to ride a bike. I had been able to ride a bike until I was 20 describes the same sequence of events of facts as 2., but is used when your current topic is a past situation—some time before the present but after your 20th year. For instance: When I was in graduate school some years ago, a friend invited me to go on a bicycle trip. I had to decline; I had been able to ride a bike until I was 20, but in my junior year I was in an accident that messed up my ankle. The preposition until designates a timespan lasting up to the timepoint named by its object, and ending at that point.
435302	Well it really depends on the writer. In some i rember one time vs anti moinitor (not sure if that was spelled correctly) he had run 10 times the speed of light straining every muscle he had. In the CW tv series he tops off around mach 2. And the trillion times the speed of light the writer also said it was a hair under the speed of light. The writer got the math wrong. Anyways the point is Barry is faster than light in most situations but how much faster varies on the writers and in the tv show he tops off around mach 2 and even in the show he has feats which show him going much faster. For example when he saved Harrison Wells from a bolt of lightning. He was running 3-4 times the speed of the lightning. Lightning travels on average 220,000 mph. Much slower than light but much faster than mach 2 which is around 1500 mph
598016	I am adding to some good answers here that I gave upvotes to. I think there is a little more that should be said to completely clear up the conclusion. I like the terms accurate and correct as Efron defines them. I gave a lengthy discussion on this very recently on a different question. Moderate whuber really liked that answer. I will not go to the same lnegth to repeat that here. However to Efron accuracy relates to the confidence level and correctness to the width or tightness of the interval. But you can't talk about tightness without considering accuracy first. Some confidence intervals are exact those are accurate because they have the actual coverage that they advertise. A 95% confidence interval can also be approximate because it uses an asymptotic distribution. Approximate intervals based on asymptotics are for a finite sample size n not going to have the advertised coverage which is the coverage you would get if the asymptotic distributionwere the exact distribution. So an approximate interval could undercover (i.e. advertise 95% when its actual coverage is only 91%) or in the rare but less serious case overcover (i.e. advertised coverage is 95% but actual in 98%). In the former case we worry about how close the actual coverage is to the advertised coverage). A measure of closeness is the order of accuracy which could be say 1/√n or 1/n. If the actual confidence level is close we call it accurate. Accuray is important with bootstrap confidence intervals which are never exact but some variants are more accurate than others. This definition of accuracy may be different to the one the OP is referring to but it should be clear now what Efron's definition is and why it is important to be accurate. Now if you have two methods that are exact we can prefer one over the other if for any confidence level it has the smaller expected width. A confidence interval that is best in this sense (sometime called shortest) would be the one to choose. But this required exactness. If the confidence level is only approximate we could be comparing apples and oranges. One could be narrower than another only because it is less accurate and hence has a lower actual coverage than its advertised coverage. If two confidence intervals are both very accurate or one is exact and the other very accurate comparing expected width may be okay because at least now we are looking at just two two varieties of apples.
1388942	A Schmitt trigger inverter is a bad idea for the first inverter which is driving the crystal directly. It may not even oscillate at all as shown, or oscillate at some undesired frequency. Note resistor R1. That is supposed to bias the inverter as a linear amplifier close to the middle of its output range. The little bit of noise generated by the inverter will be filtered by the crystal so that the part of the noise at the crystal frequency makes it back to the input of the inverter with a phase shift. It gets amplified by the inverter, filtered thru the crystal again, etc. Eventually oscillations build up to a steady level, which can take 100s of cycles or more. This assumes the first inverter is roughly a linear amplifier. A Schmitt trigger makes it highly non-linear. It will introduce frequencies of its own, and possibly overdrive the crystal. Crystals are highly tuned filters, but giving them crap to filter is not going to result in good frequency accuracy, and may allow for stable oscillations at other than the desired frequency. The second inverter being a Schmitt trigger does make some sense. The first inverter really produces a analog signal. It will be more of a sine wave than a square wave, and probably not full rail to rail amplitude. Normally, amplifying and clipping this by running thru another inverter is good enough. The Schmitt trigger should make the digital output signal a little cleaner. Usually Schmitt triggers aren't used in crystal drivers. This is because they can't be used for the first inverter, and it's easier to use multiple inverters on the same chip. The 74HC04 you mention has 6 of them on a chip, for example. Again, most of the time following the first stage with just another inverter gets you a good enough square wave. If you really need fast edges and the crystal frequency is low, then a Schmitt trigger can help. You can still do that with a 74HC04. I'd use one inverter to run the crystal, a second just as a buffer, then two with a little DC feedback around them to make the Schmitt trigger. The reason that takes two inverters is that you need positive gain. Here is what I'm talking about: Again, for many applications the output from IC1B will be good enough. Note also that this circuit requires a parallel resonant crystal. This means its frequency is specified where the phase shift is right for feedback around a amplifier with negative gain. A series resonant crystal will work but the frequency will be off a little.
553754	the number of elements in a particular period is equal to the number of vacant orbitals available to be filled in the particular shell this also follows the n+l rule according to the energies of the orbitals. Coming to first period in the first shell only one sub shell is there which is 1s and two electrons can be successively filled hence two elements are present in the first period. Second shell has two sub shells 2s and 2p which have a total of four orbitals hence eight electrons can be successively filled in the four orbitals and hence 2nd period has eight elements. The third shell has an exception due to energy considerations because of the n+l rule though the third period has three sub shells 3s , 3p and 3d and total of 9 orbitals i.e one 3s orbital three 3p orbitals and five 3d orbitals but because 3d orbitals can be filled only after 4s orbitals due to the n+l rule only four orbitals are available which are the one 3s and three 3p orbitalshence eight electrons can be successively filled and hence eight elements are present in the third period. the fourth shell has similar story with four sub shells 4s 4p 4d and 4f but because of the n+l rule or the madelung energy ordering rule 4d orbitals are filled after 5s orbitals and 4f orbitals after the 6s orbitals but here the 3d orbitals are also available to be filled up so a total of 9 orbitals i.e one 4s three 4p and five 3d orbitals are available the next periods follow suit and things happen in a similar manner . Hope it helps .
